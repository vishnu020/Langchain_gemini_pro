Numerous\\nefforts have since continued to push the boundaries of recurrent language models and encoder-decoder\\narchitectures [38, 24, 15].\\nRecurrent models typically factor computation along the symbol positions of the input and output\\nsequences. Aligning the positions to steps in computation time, they generate a sequence of hidden\\nstates ht, as a function of the previous hidden state ht−1and the input for position t. This inherently\\nsequential nature precludes parallelization within training examples, which becomes critical at longer\\nsequence lengths, as memory constraints limit batching across examples. Recent work has achieved\\nsignificant improvements in computational efficiency through factorization tricks [ 21] and conditional\\ncomputation [ 32], while also improving model performance in case of the latter. The fundamental\\nconstraint of sequential computation, however, remains.\\nAttention mechanisms have become an integral part of compelling sequence modeling and transduc-\\ntion models in various tasks, allowing modeling of dependencies without regard to their distance in\\nthe input or output sequences [ 2,19]. In all but a few cases [ 27], however, such attention mechanisms\\nare used in conjunction with a recurrent network.\\nIn this work we propose the Transformer, a model architecture eschewing recurrence and instead\\nrelying entirely on an attention mechanism to draw global dependencies between input and output.\\nThe Transformer allows for significantly more parallelization and can reach a new state of the art in\\ntranslation quality after being trained for as little as twelve hours on eight P100 GPUs.\\n2 Background\\nThe goal of reducing sequential computation also forms the foundation of the Extended Neural GPU\\n[16], ByteNet [ 18] and ConvS2S [ 9], all of which use convolutional neural networks as basic building\\nblock, computing hidden representations in parallel for all input and output positions. In these models,\\nthe number of operations required to relate signals from two arbitrary input or output positions grows\\nin the distance between positions, linearly for ConvS2S and logarithmically for ByteNet. This makes\\nit more difficult to learn dependencies between distant positions [ 12]. In the Transformer this is\\nreduced to a constant number of operations, albeit at the cost of reduced effective resolution due\\nto averaging attention-weighted positions, an effect we counteract with Multi-Head Attention as\\ndescribed in section 3.2.\\nSelf-attention, sometimes called intra-attention is an attention mechanism relating different positions\\nof a single sequence in order to compute a representation of the sequence. Self-attention has been\\nused successfully in a variety of tasks including reading comprehension, abstractive summarization,\\ntextual entailment and learning task-independent sentence representations [4, 27, 28, 22].\\nEnd-to-end memory networks are based on a recurrent attention mechanism instead of sequence-\\naligned recurrence and have been shown to perform well on simple-language question answering and\\nlanguage modeling tasks [34].\\nTo the best of our knowledge, however, the Transformer is the first transduction model relying\\nentirely on self-attention to compute representations of its input and output without using sequence-\\naligned RNNs or convolution. In the following sections, we will describe the Transformer, motivate\\nself-attention and discuss its advantages over models such as [17, 18] and [9].\\n3 Model Architecture\\nMost competitive neural sequence transduction models have an encoder-decoder structure [ 5,2,35].\\nHere, the encoder maps an input sequence of symbol representations (x1, ..., x n)to a sequence\\nof continuous representations z= (z1, ..., z n). Given z, the decoder then generates an output\\nsequence (y1, ..., y m)of symbols one element at a time. At each step the model is auto-regressive\\n[10], consuming the previously generated symbols as additional input when generating the next.\\n2Figure 1: The Transformer - model architecture.\\nThe Transformer follows this overall architecture using stacked self-attention and point-wise, fully\\nconnected layers for both the encoder and decoder, shown in the left and right halves of Figure 1,\\nrespectively.\\n3.1 Encoder and Decoder Stacks\\nEncoder: The encoder is composed of a stack of N= 6 identical layers. Each layer has two\\nsub-layers. The first is a multi-head self-attention mechanism, and the second is a simple, position-\\nwise fully connected feed-forward network. We employ a residual connection [ 11] around each of\\nthe two sub-layers, followed by layer normalization [ 1]. That is, the output of each sub-layer is\\nLayerNorm( x+ Sublayer( x)), where Sublayer( x)is the function implemented by the sub-layer\\nitself. To facilitate these residual connections, all sub-layers in the model, as well as the embedding\\nlayers, produce outputs of dimension dmodel = 512 .\\nDecoder: The decoder is also composed of a stack of N= 6identical layers. In addition to the two\\nsub-layers in each encoder layer, the decoder inserts a third sub-layer, which performs multi-head\\nattention over the output of the encoder stack. Similar to the encoder, we employ residual connections\\naround each of the sub-layers, followed by layer normalization. We also modify the self-attention\\nsub-layer in the decoder stack to prevent positions from attending to subsequent positions. This\\nmasking, combined with fact that the output embeddings are offset by one position, ensures that the\\npredictions for position ican depend only on the known outputs at positions less than i.\\n3.2 Attention\\nAn attention function can be described as mapping a query and a set of key-value pairs to an output,\\nwhere the query, keys, values, and output are all vectors. The output is computed as a weighted sum\\n3Scaled Dot-Product Attention\\n Multi-Head Attention\\nFigure 2: (left) Scaled Dot-Product Attention. (right) Multi-Head Attention consists of several\\nattention layers running in parallel.\\nof the values, where the weight assigned to each value is computed by a compatibility function of the\\nquery with the corresponding key.\\n3.2.1 Scaled Dot-Product Attention\\nWe call our particular attention \"Scaled Dot-Product Attention\" (Figure 2). The input consists of\\nqueries and keys of dimension dk, and values of dimension dv. We compute the dot products of the\\nquery with all keys, divide each by√dk, and apply a softmax function to obtain the weights on the\\nvalues.\\nIn practice, we compute the attention function on a set of queries simultaneously, packed together\\ninto a matrix Q. The keys and values are also packed together into matrices KandV. We compute\\nthe matrix of outputs as:\\nAttention( Q, K, V ) = softmax(QKT\\n√dk)V (1)\\nThe two most commonly used attention functions are additive attention [ 2], and dot-product (multi-\\nplicative) attention. Dot-product attention is identical to our algorithm, except for the scaling factor\\nof1√dk. Additive attention computes the compatibility function using a feed-forward network with\\na single hidden layer. While the two are similar in theoretical complexity, dot-product attention is\\nmuch faster and more space-efficient in practice, since it can be implemented using highly optimized\\nmatrix multiplication code.\\nWhile for small values of dkthe two mechanisms perform similarly, additive attention outperforms\\ndot product attention without scaling for larger values of dk[3]. We suspect that for large values of\\ndk, the dot products grow large in magnitude, pushing the softmax function into regions where it has\\nextremely small gradients4. To counteract this effect, we scale the dot products by1√dk.\\n3.2.2 Multi-Head Attention\\nInstead of performing a single attention function with dmodel-dimensional keys, values and queries,\\nwe found it beneficial to linearly project the queries, keys and values htimes with different, learned\\nlinear projections to dk,dkanddvdimensions, respectively. On each of these projected versions of\\nqueries, keys and values we then perform the attention function in parallel, yielding dv-dimensional\\n4To illustrate why the dot products get large, assume that the components of qandkare independent random\\nvariables with mean 0and variance 1. Then their dot product, q·k=Pdk\\ni=1qiki, has mean 0and variance dk.\\n4output values. These are concatenated and once again projected, resulting in the final values, as\\ndepicted in Figure 2.\\nMulti-head attention allows the model to jointly attend to information from different representation\\nsubspaces at different positions. With a single attention head, averaging inhibits this.\\nMultiHead( Q, K, V ) = Concat(head 1, ...,head h)WO\\nwhere head i= Attention( QWQ\\ni, KWK\\ni, V WV\\ni)\\nWhere the projections are parameter matrices WQ\\ni∈Rdmodel×dk,WK\\ni∈Rdmodel×dk,WV\\ni∈Rdmodel×dv\\nandWO∈Rhdv×dmodel.\\nIn this work we employ h= 8 parallel attention layers, or heads. For each of these we use\\ndk=dv=dmodel/h= 64 . Due to the reduced dimension of each head, the total computational cost\\nis similar to that of single-head attention with full dimensionality.\\n3.2.3 Applications of Attention in our Model\\nThe Transformer uses multi-head attention in three different ways:\\n•In \"encoder-decoder attention\" layers, the queries come from the previous decoder layer,\\nand the memory keys and values come from the output of the encoder. This allows every\\nposition in the decoder to attend over all positions in the input sequence. This mimics the\\ntypical encoder-decoder attention mechanisms in sequence-to-sequence models such as\\n[38, 2, 9].\\n•The encoder contains self-attention layers. In a self-attention layer all of the keys, values\\nand queries come from the same place, in this case, the output of the previous layer in the\\nencoder. Each position in the encoder can attend to all positions in the previous layer of the\\nencoder.\\n•Similarly, self-attention layers in the decoder allow each position in the decoder to attend to\\nall positions in the decoder up to and including that position. We need to prevent leftward\\ninformation flow in the decoder to preserve the auto-regressive property. We implement this\\ninside of scaled dot-product attention by masking out (setting to −∞) all values in the input\\nof the softmax which correspond to illegal connections. See Figure 2.\\n3.3 Position-wise Feed-Forward Networks\\nIn addition to attention sub-layers, each of the layers in our encoder and decoder contains a fully\\nconnected feed-forward network, which is applied to each position separately and identically. This\\nconsists of two linear transformations with a ReLU activation in between.\\nFFN( x) = max(0 , xW 1+b1)W2+b2 (2)\\nWhile the linear transformations are the same across different positions, they use different parameters\\nfrom layer to layer. Another way of describing this is as two convolutions with kernel size 1.\\nThe dimensionality of input and output is dmodel = 512 , and the inner-layer has dimensionality\\ndff= 2048 .\\n3.4 Embeddings and Softmax\\nSimilarly to other sequence transduction models, we use learned embeddings to convert the input\\ntokens and output tokens to vectors of dimension dmodel. We also use the usual learned linear transfor-\\nmation and softmax function to convert the decoder output to predicted next-token probabilities. In\\nour model, we share the same weight matrix between the two embedding layers and the pre-softmax\\nlinear transformation, similar to [ 30]. In the embedding layers, we multiply those weights by√dmodel.\\n5Table 1: Maximum path lengths, per-layer complexity and minimum number of sequential operations\\nfor different layer types. nis the sequence length, dis the representation dimension, kis the kernel\\nsize of convolutions and rthe size of the neighborhood in restricted self-attention.\\nLayer Type Complexity per Layer Sequential Maximum Path Length\\nOperations\\nSelf-Attention O(n2·d) O(1) O(1)\\nRecurrent O(n·d2) O(n) O(n)\\nConvolutional O(k·n·d2) O(1) O(logk(n))\\nSelf-Attention (restricted) O(r·n·d) O(1) O(n/r)\\n3.5 Positional Encoding\\nSince our model contains no recurrence and no convolution, in order for the model to make use of the\\norder of the sequence, we must inject some information about the relative or absolute position of the\\ntokens in the sequence. To this end, we add \"positional encodings\" to the input embeddings at the\\nbottoms of the encoder and decoder stacks. The positional encodings have the same dimension dmodel\\nas the embeddings, so that the two can be summed. There are many choices of positional encodings,\\nlearned and fixed [9].\\nIn this work, we use sine and cosine functions of different frequencies:\\nPE(pos,2i)=sin(pos/100002i/d model)\\nPE(pos,2i+1)=cos(pos/100002i/d model)\\nwhere posis the position and iis the dimension. That is, each dimension of the positional encoding\\ncorresponds to a sinusoid. The wavelengths form a geometric progression from 2πto10000 ·2π. We\\nchose this function because we hypothesized it would allow the model to easily learn to attend by\\nrelative positions, since for any fixed offset k,PEpos+kcan be represented as a linear function of\\nPEpos.\\nWe also experimented with using learned positional embeddings [ 9] instead, and found that the two\\nversions produced nearly identical results (see Table 3 row (E)). We chose the sinusoidal version\\nbecause it may allow the model to extrapolate to sequence lengths longer than the ones encountered\\nduring training.\\n4 Why Self-Attention\\nIn this section we compare various aspects of self-attention layers to the recurrent and convolu-\\ntional layers commonly used for mapping one variable-length sequence of symbol representations\\n(x1, ..., x n)to another sequence of equal length (z1, ..., z n), with xi, zi∈Rd, such as a hidden\\nlayer in a typical sequence transduction encoder or decoder. Motivating our use of self-attention we\\nconsider three desiderata.\\nOne is the total computational complexity per layer. Another is the amount of computation that can\\nbe parallelized, as measured by the minimum number of sequential operations required.\\nThe third is the path length between long-range dependencies in the network. Learning long-range\\ndependencies is a key challenge in many sequence transduction tasks. One key factor affecting the\\nability to learn such dependencies is the length of the paths forward and backward signals have to\\ntraverse in the network. The shorter these paths between any combination of positions in the input\\nand output sequences, the easier it is to learn long-range dependencies [ 12]. Hence we also compare\\nthe maximum path length between any two input and output positions in networks composed of the\\ndifferent layer types.\\nAs noted in Table 1, a self-attention layer connects all positions with a constant number of sequentially\\nexecuted operations, whereas a recurrent layer requires O(n)sequential operations. In terms of\\ncomputational complexity, self-attention layers are faster than recurrent layers when the sequence\\n6length nis smaller than the representation dimensionality d, which is most often the case with\\nsentence representations used by state-of-the-art models in machine translations, such as word-piece\\n[38] and byte-pair [ 31] representations. To improve computational performance for tasks involving\\nvery long sequences, self-attention could be restricted to considering only a neighborhood of size rin\\nthe input sequence centered around the respective output position. This would increase the maximum\\npath length to O(n/r). We plan to investigate this approach further in future work.\\nA single convolutional layer with kernel width k < n does not connect all pairs of input and output\\npositions. Doing so requires a stack of O(n/k)convolutional layers in the case of contiguous kernels,\\norO(logk(n))in the case of dilated convolutions [ 18], increasing the length of the longest paths\\nbetween any two positions in the network. Convolutional layers are generally more expensive than\\nrecurrent layers, by a factor of k. Separable convolutions [ 6], however, decrease the complexity\\nconsiderably, to O(k·n·d+n·d2). Even with k=n, however, the complexity of a separable\\nconvolution is equal to the combination of a self-attention layer and a point-wise feed-forward layer,\\nthe approach we take in our model.\\nAs side benefit, self-attention could yield more interpretable models. We inspect attention distributions\\nfrom our models and present and discuss examples in the appendix. Not only do individual attention\\nheads clearly learn to perform different tasks, many appear to exhibit behavior related to the syntactic\\nand semantic structure of the sentences.\\n5 Training\\nThis section describes the training regime for our models.\\n5.1 Training Data and Batching\\nWe trained on the standard WMT 2014 English-German dataset consisting of about 4.5 million\\nsentence pairs. Sentences were encoded using byte-pair encoding [ 3], which has a shared source-\\ntarget vocabulary of about 37000 tokens. For English-French, we used the significantly larger WMT\\n2014 English-French dataset consisting of 36M sentences and split tokens into a 32000 word-piece\\nvocabulary [ 38]. Sentence pairs were batched together by approximate sequence length. Each training\\nbatch contained a set of sentence pairs containing approximately 25000 source tokens and 25000\\ntarget tokens.\\n5.2 Hardware and Schedule\\nWe trained our models on one machine with 8 NVIDIA P100 GPUs. For our base models using\\nthe hyperparameters described throughout the paper, each training step took about 0.4 seconds. We\\ntrained the base models for a total of 100,000 steps or 12 hours. For our big models,(described on the\\nbottom line of table 3), step time was 1.0 seconds. The big models were trained for 300,000 steps\\n(3.5 days).\\n5.3 Optimizer\\nWe used the Adam optimizer [ 20] with β1= 0.9,β2= 0.98andϵ= 10−9. We varied the learning\\nrate over the course of training, according to the formula:\\nlrate =d−0.5\\nmodel·min(step_num−0.5, step _num·warmup _steps−1.5) (3)\\nThis corresponds to increasing the learning rate linearly for the first warmup _steps training steps,\\nand decreasing it thereafter proportionally to the inverse square root of the step number. We used\\nwarmup _steps = 4000 .\\n5.4 Regularization\\nWe employ three types of regularization during training:\\n7Table 2: The Transformer achieves better BLEU scores than previous state-of-the-art models on the\\nEnglish-to-German and English-to-French newstest2014 tests at a fraction of the training cost.\\nModelBLEU Training Cost (FLOPs)\\nEN-DE EN-FR EN-DE EN-FR\\nByteNet [18] 23.75\\nDeep-Att + PosUnk [39] 39.2 1.0·1020\\nGNMT + RL [38] 24.6 39.92 2.3·10191.4·1020\\nConvS2S [9] 25.16 40.46 9.6·10181.5·1020\\nMoE [32] 26.03 40.56 2.0·10191.2·1020\\nDeep-Att + PosUnk Ensemble [39] 40.4 8.0·1020\\nGNMT + RL Ensemble [38] 26.30 41.16 1.8·10201.1·1021\\nConvS2S Ensemble [9] 26.36 41.29 7.7·10191.2·1021\\nTransformer (base model) 27.3 38.1 3.3·1018\\nTransformer (big) 28.4 41.8 2.3·1019\\nResidual Dropout We apply dropout [ 33] to the output of each sub-layer, before it is added to the\\nsub-layer input and normalized. In addition, we apply dropout to the sums of the embeddings and the\\npositional encodings in both the encoder and decoder stacks. For the base model, we use a rate of\\nPdrop= 0.1.\\nLabel Smoothing During training, we employed label smoothing of value ϵls= 0.1[36]. This\\nhurts perplexity, as the model learns to be more unsure, but improves accuracy and BLEU score.\\n6 Results\\n6.1 Machine Translation\\nOn the WMT 2014 English-to-German translation task, the big transformer model (Transformer (big)\\nin Table 2) outperforms the best previously reported models (including ensembles) by more than 2.0\\nBLEU, establishing a new state-of-the-art BLEU score of 28.4. The configuration of this model is\\nlisted in the bottom line of Table 3. Training took 3.5days on 8P100 GPUs. Even our base model\\nsurpasses all previously published models and ensembles, at a fraction of the training cost of any of\\nthe competitive models.\\nOn the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task, our big model achieves a BLEU score of 41.0,\\noutperforming all of the previously published single models, at less than 1/4the training cost of the\\nprevious state-of-the-art model. The Transformer (big) model trained for English-to-French used\\ndropout rate Pdrop= 0.1, instead of 0.3.\\nFor the base models, we used a single model obtained by averaging the last 5 checkpoints, which\\nwere written at 10-minute intervals. For the big models, we averaged the last 20 checkpoints. We\\nused beam search with a beam size of 4and length penalty α= 0.6[38]. These hyperparameters\\nwere chosen after experimentation on the development set. We set the maximum output length during\\ninference to input length + 50, but terminate early when possible [38].\\nTable 2 summarizes our results and compares our translation quality and training costs to other model\\narchitectures from the literature. We estimate the number of floating point operations used to train a\\nmodel by multiplying the training time, the number of GPUs used, and an estimate of the sustained\\nsingle-precision floating-point capacity of each GPU5.\\n6.2 Model Variations\\nTo evaluate the importance of different components of the Transformer, we varied our base model\\nin different ways, measuring the change in performance on English-to-German translation on the\\n5We used values of 2.8, 3.7, 6.0 and 9.5 TFLOPS for K80, K40, M40 and P100, respectively.\\n8Table 3: Variations on the Transformer architecture.

We further observe in rows (C) and (D) that, as expected,\\nbigger models are better, and dropout is very helpful in avoiding over-fitting. In row (E) we replace our\\nsinusoidal positional encoding with learned positional embeddings [ 9], and observe nearly identical\\nresults to the base model.\\n6.3 English Constituency Parsing\\nTo evaluate if the Transformer can generalize to other tasks we performed experiments on English\\nconstituency parsing. This task presents specific challenges: the output is subject to strong structural\\nconstraints and is significantly longer than the input. Furthermore, RNN sequence-to-sequence\\nmodels have not been able to attain state-of-the-art results in small-data regimes [37].\\nWe trained a 4-layer transformer with dmodel = 1024 on the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) portion of the\\nPenn Treebank [ 25], about 40K training sentences. We also trained it in a semi-supervised setting,\\nusing the larger high-confidence and BerkleyParser corpora from with approximately 17M sentences\\n[37]. We used a vocabulary of 16K tokens for the WSJ only setting and a vocabulary of 32K tokens\\nfor the semi-supervised setting.\\nWe performed only a small number of experiments to select the dropout, both attention and residual\\n(section 5.4), learning rates and beam size on the Section 22 development set, all other parameters\\nremained unchanged from the English-to-German base translation model. During inference, we\\n9Table 4: The Transformer generalizes well to English constituency parsing (Results are on Section 23\\nof WSJ)\\nParser Training WSJ 23 F1\\nVinyals & Kaiser el al.

On both WMT 2014 English-to-German and WMT 2014\\nEnglish-to-French translation tasks, we achieve a new state of the art. In the former task our best\\nmodel outperforms even all previously reported ensembles.\\nWe are excited about the future of attention-based models and plan to apply them to other tasks. We\\nplan to extend the Transformer to problems involving input and output modalities other than text and\\nto investigate local, restricted attention mechanisms to efficiently handle large inputs and outputs\\nsuch as images, audio and video. Making generation less sequential is another research goals of ours.\\nThe code we used to train and evaluate our models is available at https://github.com/\\ntensorflow/tensor2tensor .\\nAcknowledgements We are grateful to Nal Kalchbrenner and Stephan Gouws for their fruitful\\ncomments, corrections and inspiration.\\nReferences\\n[1]Jimmy Lei Ba, Jamie Ryan Kiros, and Geoffrey E Hinton.

They may not know what the components are, where they came from, or \\nhow they were put together. People just expect their machines and devices to work. And they do work, thanks to \\nelectronics manufacturers.  \\nOur lives and our communities depend on electronics. And that reliance is only going to grow as systems become \\nsmarter. We are moving toward a world of self-driving vehicles, immersive virtual experiences, and automated \\nenvironments. All of these innovations will be fueled by electronics manufacturers. \\nIn addition to influencing how we live, work, and play on a daily basis, electronics manufacturers comprise a \\nsignificant component of the nation’s industrial base. To update and deepen our knowledge of the industry, IPC \\nworked with INFORUM (Interindustry Forecasting at the University of Maryland) to measure the contributions of \\nelectronics manufacturers to the U.S. economy. \\nAt each step of the electronics manufacturing supply chain, workers earn compensation, and value is added to \\nthe national economy. In addition to these direct impacts, electronics manufacturers also purchase goods and \\nservices from other domestic industries, generating indirect economic activity in those industries. Likewise, \\nemployees in the electronics manufacturing sector spend their earnings on groceries, services, and consumer \\ngoods, and those induced benefits help local and national economies in additional ways. \\nThese direct, indirect and induced effects can be measured across employment, income, output, and contribution \\nto economic growth. These are the tangible economic benefits of electronics manufacturing in the United States. \\nHowever, there are intangible benefits that are equally meaningful. It’s the connection you feel when you reach \\na loved one on the phone, no matter where they are. The security you feel driving a vehicle with cutting-edge \\nsafety features. The laughter you enjoy watching the latest comedy on your connected television – or on your \\ntablet while away from home. Or the relief you feel when medical professionals take care of your health with \\nstate-of-the-art equipment. \\nThese intangible benefits and many more like them are the result of continuous innovation by electronics \\nmanufacturers. \\nJohn Mitchell  \\nPresident and CEO \\nIPC\\ni\\nThe Economic Impacts of the  U.S. Electronics Manufacturing SectorTABLE OF CONTENTS\\nList of Tables ............................................................. ii\\nList of Figures ............................................................ iii\\nExecutive Summary ....................................................... 4\\n1.

In the United States, IPC represents more \\nthan 2,700 member-company sites across a diverse collection of industries that are integral parts of the economy. \\nIn addition to summarizing the industry’s direct effects, such as output and labor income, this report provides a \\nmore comprehensive view of electronics manufacturing’s economic contributions.\\nWhen electronics manufacturers purchase services and goods from other sectors to use as inputs in the products \\nthey design and build, they produce economic activity in those sectors. The economic impact created in these \\nsupply chains are called indirect effects. \\nLikewise, employees in the electronics manufacturing sector and related supply chains spend their earnings \\nin downstream sectors, which, in turn, produces a range of economic activities at the local and national levels. \\nThese economic contributions are called induced effects. The total economic contribution of the electronics \\nmanufacturing sector includes these direct, indirect and induced effects.1\\nThis report finds:   \\n• Direct Effects: In the United States, electronics manufacturers directly employ more than 1.3 million workers, \\ncontribute $165.7 billion in labor income and $307.6 billion to GDP , and produce nearly $710 billion in output. \\nThe electronics manufacturing sector plays a vital role in the national economy, accounting for 1.6 percent of \\nGDP and 0.7 percent of jobs. \\n• Indirect and Induced Effects: Including both indirect and induced effects, U.S. electronics manufacturers \\nsupport nearly 5.3 million U.S. jobs, contribute almost $408 billion in labor income each year and $714 \\nbillion to U.S. GDP , and produce $1.46 trillion in output (see Table ES-1). The direct, indirect and induced \\neconomic activity of the electronics manufacturing sector accounts for 3.7 percent of U.S. GDP and 2.8 \\npercent of U.S. jobs. \\nTable ES-1.

Appendix B provides estimated impacts through 2019.5\\nThe Economic Impacts of the  U.S. Electronics Manufacturing Sector• Multiplier Effects: The electronics manufacturing industry has an impactful “multiplier effect.” That is, every \\none electronics manufacturing job in the U.S. helps support over three additional jobs in the U.S. economy. \\nLikewise, every dollar in labor income in U.S. electronics manufacturing produces another $1.46 in other \\nsectors of the economy. Every dollar added to U.S. GDP by the electronics manufacturing sector creates \\n$1.32 elsewhere in the economy. Additionally, every dollar in electronics manufacturing output generates \\n$1.05 of output elsewhere in the economy.\\n• State-Level Employment: The economic impact of the electronics manufacturing sector is important in many \\nindividual states. Ten states have more than 100,000 workers each because of the electronics manufacturing \\nsector. California’s electronics manufacturers directly and indirectly employ more than 942,000 employees, \\nfollowed by Texas (437,400), Massachusetts (160,000), New York (156,000) and Florida (137,000). The sector’s \\ndirect employment in these five states is nearly 554,000, not to mention an additional 1.2 million indirect and \\ninduced jobs (See Figure ES-1). \\nFigure ES-1.

In California, electronics manufacturing supports $97.6 billion in labor income \\neach year, followed by Texas ($28.6 billion), Massachusetts ($15.8 billion), New York ($14.2 billion) and \\nMinnesota ($11.1 billion). \\n• State-Level GDP: In terms of GDP , Oregon’s electronics manufacturing sector directly accounts for nearly 10 \\npercent of state GDP , followed by California (3.4 percent), Massachusetts (2.8 percent) and Minnesota (2.7 \\npercent).\\n• State-Level Output: California, Texas, Massachusetts, New York and Oregon collectively account for over \\n52 percent of national direct electronics manufacturing output. Inclusive of indirect and induced output, \\nCalifornia alone has over $300 billion in annual electronics manufacturing output, followed by Texas at over \\n$110 billion.

INTRODUCTION\\nThe electronics manufacturing sector is a vibrant and dynamic segment of the U.S. economy, with a long \\nhistory of innovation and resiliency dating back to Lee de Forest’s 1906 invention of the three-element vacuum \\ntube. The 1940s brought the introduction of semiconductors, which spawned the modern era of computing and \\ntelecommunications. \\nToday the electronics manufacturing sector is the heart of innovation in every sector of the economy. \\nSmartphones are allowing individuals to connect instantly with friends and family anywhere in the world or order \\ngroceries for home delivery. Robots are transforming warehouse and delivery industries. Cutting-edge medical \\ndiagnostic equipment is saving and improving lives. Electronics manufacturers are empowering the next wave of \\nelectric vehicles, autonomous robots, and top-secret defense technologies.  \\nThe electronics manufacturing sector includes such household names as Apple, Bosch, DuPont, Foxconn, GE \\nMedical Systems, Honeywell, IBM, Intel, Jabil, Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman, and Raytheon. However, 80 \\npercent of U.S. electronics manufacturers are small and medium-sized businesses. Economic activities by these \\ncompanies drive innovation, output and jobs in adjacent industries such as aerospace, automotive, medical and \\ndefense.   \\nThis study finds that the electronics manufacturing sector directly contributes roughly $308 billion to U.S. GDP \\nand employs over 1.3 million U.S. workers. The electronics manufacturing sector accounts for 1.6 percent of \\nU.S. GDP and 0.7 percent of U.S. jobs. Electronics manufacturing activity, however, does not exist in isolation. \\nIncluding both indirect and induced effects, U.S. electronics manufacturers support nearly 5.3 million jobs, \\ncontribute almost $408 billion in labor income each year, add $714 billion to GDP , and produce $1.46 trillion in \\noutput. The direct, indirect and induced economic activity of the electronics manufacturing sector accounts for 3.7 \\npercent of U.S. GDP and 2.8 percent of U.S. jobs. \\nThe following section describes the methodology used to estimate these impacts. Section 3 provides quantitative \\nresults showing electronics manufacturing’s contribution at the national and state levels. Section 4 provides \\na quantitative analysis of where the output of U.S. electronics manufacturers goes. Appendix A contains Fact \\nSheets for the entire United States and the top 16 U.S. states ranked by output of electronics manufacturing. 8\\nINTERCONNECTING AMERICA’S ECONOMY: 2. METHODOLOGY AND KEY TERMS\\nThis study defines electronics manufacturing to include the following diverse industries in the North American \\nIndustry Classification System (NAICS):\\n• NAICS 3341 - Computer and Peripheral Equipment Manufacturing\\n• NAICS 3342 - Communications Equipment Manufacturing\\n• NAICS 3343 - Audio and Video Equipment Manufacturing\\n• NAICS 3344 - Semiconductor and Other Electronic Component Manufacturing\\n• NAICS 3345 - Navigational, Measuring, Electromedical, and Control Instruments Manufacturing\\n• NAICS 3353 – Electrical Equipment Manufacturing\\n• NAICS 3359 - Other Electrical Equipment and Component Manufacturing\\n• NAICS 33632 - Motor Vehicle Electrical and Electronic Equipment Manufacturing\\nThe calculated economic impacts presented in this study use input-output (IO) analysis to quantify the \\ninterdependencies that exist between different sectors of the economy. IO analysis can be used to estimate chains \\nof effects that occur through the interrelationships among businesses, government and households. In this way, \\nIO analysis enables an examination of interindustry relationships within an economy and, in turn, can characterize \\nthe effects of a change in one sector on the broader economy. This analysis uses the 2017 IMPLAN database and \\nmodel. All economic impacts are in inflation-adjusted 2017 dollars (2017$). All results are for calendar year 2017. \\nThe three types of economic impacts we derive in this study are:\\n• Direct Impacts—Activity generated within the focus industry. In this case, electronics manufacturing activity \\nserves as the direct impact.\\n• Indirect Impacts—Activity generated in other industries as a result of purchases (materials, energy and \\nservices) by the focus industry through the supply chain. For example, an automobile manufacturing firm \\nmight purchase tires, steel and electrical components to produce its final product.\\n• Induced Impacts—Activity generated by purchases of households from income earned from direct and \\nindirect production. \\nThis report provides estimates for the direct, indirect, and induced impacts on:\\n• Employment — Employment is the people employed by an industry. Employment figures use the Bureau \\nof Economic Analysis (BEA) and Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) full-time/part-time annual average for a \\ngiven industry. The data covers both wage and salary employees and those who are self-employed.\\n• Labor Income — Labor income, a component of value added, is the sum of salary/wages and supplements. \\nSupplements may take the form of employer contributions for employee pensions and insurance funds \\n(such as health insurance). This measure also includes proprietor income.\\n• Value Added — Value added is the industry’s contribution to GDP and represents the enhancement a \\nmanufacturer provides (e.g., assembly) to a product before offering it to the end consumer. Put another \\nway, value added is the difference between total revenue of an industry and the cost of intermediate \\ninputs. Components of value added include employee labor compensation, taxes on production and \\nimports, and gross operating surplus (including profits).\\n• Output — Output, in economic terms, refers to the total value of all goods and services produced by an \\nindustry. This includes both intermediate demand (sales of intermediate inputs to other industries) and \\nfinal demand.9\\nThe Economic Impacts of the  U.S. Electronics Manufacturing SectorIO analysis utilizes tables that show the interrelationships between industries. Looking down the column of a \\ntable, we see all the inputs of other industries used to produce that industry’s product. Looking across the row \\nof a table, we see the industries and final uses that industry sells to. We use these tables to calculate the indirect \\nimpacts of a given industry’s production.\\nEach analysis presented in this report focuses on a region, such as the United States or one state, and examines \\nthe total contributions of the electronics manufacturing sector in that region. \\nMeasures of output include double-counting. For example, the tire used to build a motor vehicle is counted both \\nas output of tires and as output of motor vehicles. This is important only if both are produced in the same region. \\nHowever, employment, labor income and value added are additive, that is to say, not double-counted. Many slices \\nof value added contribute to the final value of a product or service.\\nIn addition to analyzing the economic contribution at the national level, this report also quantifies electronics \\nmanufacturing’s impact for 16 state economies. The following list represents the top 16 states ranked by output of \\nelectronics manufacturing. These states, listed here in alphabetical order, account for approximately 80 percent of \\nnational electronics manufacturing output. \\n1. Arizona\\n2. California\\n3. Colorado\\n4. Florida\\n5.

It provides a look at both \\ndirect impacts and a more comprehensive view of manufacturing’s contributions to the economy by including \\nindirect and induced impacts.

Output and jobs are also supported in supplier (“indirect”) industries \\nthat provide components, materials, energy and various services to the electronics manufacturing sector. \\nAdditionally, individuals employed by electronics manufacturers and related suppliers earn income, a portion \\nof which is used to purchase consumer goods and services, creating jobs and output in other industries. These \\neconomic impacts are known as “induced” effects.\\nTable 2 summarizes the sector’s direct, indirect, and induced impacts in employment, labor income, value added, \\nand output. Electronics manufacturers directly employ over 1.3 million people, generate over $307 billion in value \\nadded and contribute nearly $710 billion in output. This can be seen in the first row of Table 2. \\nIn total, electronics manufacturing activity helps support 5.3 million  \\njobs and $714 billion in value added to the national economy.\\nDirect economic activity by the electronics manufacturing sector also generates economic activity throughout \\nother sectors of the country, as shown on the second row of Table 2. As a of result of annual economic activity by \\nelectronics manufacturers, upstream suppliers generate over $340 billion in output and employ nearly 1.5 million \\npeople. The supply chain adds $176.6 billion to GDP as a result of economic activity by electronics manufacturers. \\nFinally, a portion of the labor income earned by workers in electronics manufacturing and related suppliers is \\nspent on goods and services in other sectors of the economy. This activity, shown in the third row of Table 2, \\nsupports nearly 2.5 million jobs and generates over $400 billion in output. \\nIn total, the electronics manufacturing sector helps support approximately 5.3 million U.S. jobs; produces nearly \\n$408 billion in labor income; contributes $714 billion to U.S. GDP; and drives $1.5 trillion in U.S. output. \\nEconomic multipliers illustrate the impact one sector has on the broader economy. In mathematical terms, \\neconomic multipliers describe the ratio of the sum of indirect and induced impacts to direct impacts. The data \\nshown in Table 2 and Figure 3 indicate that one electronics manufacturing job helps support 3.0 other jobs in \\nthe national economy.2 Additionally, one dollar in electronics manufacturing output generates $1.05 of output \\nelsewhere in the economy.3 Additional information on electronics manufacturing’s contributions can be found in \\nFact Sheet #1 of Appendix A.\\nTable 2.

END-USE ANALYSIS\\nSection 3 described the upstream supply-chain effects of the electronics manufacturing industry. Section 4 \\nchanges focus and addresses where manufactured electronics ultimately end up. This report describes five types \\nof end use as well as the total category:\\n1. Personal Consumption Expenditures — These are goods and services purchased by individuals for \\nprivate use.\\n2. Investment & Inventory Change — Investment includes all purchases of equipment, structures, and \\nintellectual property purchased by private businesses. Inventory change describes the change in physical \\nvolume of inventories owned by businesses from one period to another.\\n3. Government: Federal Defense — This category includes both consumption expenditures and investment \\nmade by the federal government for defense purposes.\\n4. Government: All Other — The remainder of government activity is contained in this category. It includes all \\nnon-defense expenditures at the federal, state and local levels.\\n5. Exports — Exports are goods and services sold by domestic businesses to foreign individuals, private \\nbusinesses and governments.\\n6. Final Sales — This is defined as the sum of personal consumption expenditures, investment and inventory \\nchange, government spending and exports.\\nThe impacts presented show the electronics manufacturing content in all categories of final sales. This would \\ninclude, for example, semiconductors in personal motor vehicles or electronic components in communication \\nequipment or in other defense-related equipment bought by the U.S. Defense Department.\\nIn total, the electronics manufacturing industry is \\nresponsible for over $1.0 trillion in content of final sales. \\nGiven their wide variety of applications, electronic goods are well represented in each of the categories listed \\nabove. Figure 9 illustrates the total end-use content by each of these five categories. Investment and inventory \\nchange account for the greatest share, making up 40.9 percent ($426.6 billion) of the total. The next largest share \\nof electronic goods, 29.4 percent ($306.5 billion), end up in personal consumption expenditures. Finally, exports \\n($223.9 billion; 21.5 percent), federal defense ($37.8 billion; 3.6 percent) and other government purchases ($48.1 \\nbillion; 4.6 percent) make up the remainder. In total, the electronics manufacturing industry is responsible for over \\n$1.0 trillion in content of final sales.22\\nINTERCONNECTING AMERICA’S ECONOMY: Figure 9.

These inputs are goods and services required to produce the product which is ultimately sold to final-\\ndemand markets.   \\nTable 16 and Figure 13 show purchases of intermediate electronic inputs in the automotive sector in 2017. \\nWithin this sector, the automobiles and motor vehicle parts industries comprised the vast majority of \\nintermediate expenditures of electronic goods. In both of these sub-sectors, the main inputs being purchased are \\nsemiconductors and other electronic components (NAICS 3344). Purchases of IPC-related goods accounted for \\nroughly 2.7 percent of the automotive sector’s intermediate purchases.\\nTable 17 and Figure 14 show purchases of intermediate electronic inputs by the aerospace sector. The aircraft \\nsub-sector spent over $14 billion on such purchases in 2017, and the overall sector spent close to $26 billion. IPC-\\nrelated products comprised 11.3 percent of all aerospace sector intermediate expenditures in 2017.\\nFinally, Table 18 and Figure 15 display purchases of intermediate electronic inputs by the medical services \\nsector in 2017. The aggregate medical services sector spends in excess of $10 billion in intermediate purchases \\nof electronics. Over half of this was devoted to NAICS 3345 (which includes electromedical equipment), while \\nanother large share was traced to NAICS 3344 (semiconductors and other electronic components). IPC-related \\nproducts make up a relatively small share (0.4 percent) of medical services’ intermediate inputs.29\\nThe Economic Impacts of the  U.S. Electronics Manufacturing SectorTable 16.

CONCLUSIONS \\nThe electronics manufacturing sector fills many critical roles in the U.S. economy, and in dozens of adjacent \\nindustries, including transportation, aerospace and defense, and medical services, among many others. \\nWhile its goods and services are generally hidden out of sight, the industry designs, builds, tests, and services \\nthousands of intermediate and final products used billions of times per day by consumers around the world. \\nThe many positive economic impacts of electronics manufacturing in the United States include millions of jobs, \\nand hundreds of billions of dollars’ worth of labor income and value-added. \\nThe benefits are most pronounced in 16 states that account for approximately 80 percent of national electronics \\nmanufacturing output; but the benefits are also generated in and shared across all 50 states and U.S territories.\\nAnd while this report does not delve into the implications of this industry’s value to the economy, it is clear that \\nthe industry has thrived in the United States due to that nation’s longtime strengths in education, workforce, \\nresearch, innovation, and business environment. \\nTo the extent those historic strengths may be at risk in today’s world, the United States risks its future world \\nleadership and prosperity. Leaders in United States and all nations who are interested in future prosperity should \\ngive high priority to creating a positive policy and business environment for the electronics manufacturing \\nindustry. \\nIPC will continue to foster and promote industry standards to help ensure superior quality of electronics products \\nand services, environmentally friendly operations, and intellectual property protection. We will continue to \\noperate the industry’s leading training and worker certifications to help provide the workforce of today and \\ntomorrow. We will conduct and publish unique industry research to help all parties make more informed \\ndecisions. And we will continue to advocate for pro-growth, pro-innovation, science-based policies in all nations.\\n 33\\nThe Economic Impacts of the  U.S. Electronics Manufacturing SectorAPPENDIX A – NATIONAL AND STATE FACT SHEETS\\nAppendix A contains Fact Sheets which summarize information for the entire United States and 16 specific states. \\nAll data was sourced from IMPLAN and applies to the year 2017. \\nFact Sheets are provided for the following states: \\n1.

These pertain to the entire economy, helping to \\ngive perspective to the electronics manufacturing impacts listed underneath. \\nThe second block summarizes the industry’s direct economic effects in terms of employment, labor income, value \\nadded, and output. The chart also shows electronics manufacturing’s share of regional GDP , calculated by dividing \\ndirect value-added by the gross regional product. Labor income per worker is derived by dividing electronics \\nmanufacturing labor income by employment.\\nThe third block in each table describes electronics manufacturing’s direct impacts, the impacts of upstream \\nsuppliers (indirect), and associated income-related (induced) effects.\\nNext, two different multipliers are provided. Economic multipliers describe the ratio of the sum of indirect and \\ninduced impacts to direct impacts. For employment multipliers, take the sum of indirect and induced employment \\nand divide it by direct employment. Similarly, output multipliers can be calculated by adding indirect and induced \\noutput together and dividing it by direct output.\\n 34\\nINTERCONNECTING AMERICA’S ECONOMY: Fact Sheet 1.

Numerous\\nefforts have since continued to push the boundaries of recurrent language models and encoder-decoder\\narchitectures [38, 24, 15].\\nRecurrent models typically factor computation along the symbol positions of the input and output\\nsequences. Aligning the positions to steps in computation time, they generate a sequence of hidden\\nstates ht, as a function of the previous hidden state ht−1and the input for position t. This inherently\\nsequential nature precludes parallelization within training examples, which becomes critical at longer\\nsequence lengths, as memory constraints limit batching across examples. Recent work has achieved\\nsignificant improvements in computational efficiency through factorization tricks [ 21] and conditional\\ncomputation [ 32], while also improving model performance in case of the latter. The fundamental\\nconstraint of sequential computation, however, remains.\\nAttention mechanisms have become an integral part of compelling sequence modeling and transduc-\\ntion models in various tasks, allowing modeling of dependencies without regard to their distance in\\nthe input or output sequences [ 2,19]. In all but a few cases [ 27], however, such attention mechanisms\\nare used in conjunction with a recurrent network.\\nIn this work we propose the Transformer, a model architecture eschewing recurrence and instead\\nrelying entirely on an attention mechanism to draw global dependencies between input and output.\\nThe Transformer allows for significantly more parallelization and can reach a new state of the art in\\ntranslation quality after being trained for as little as twelve hours on eight P100 GPUs.\\n2 Background\\nThe goal of reducing sequential computation also forms the foundation of the Extended Neural GPU\\n[16], ByteNet [ 18] and ConvS2S [ 9], all of which use convolutional neural networks as basic building\\nblock, computing hidden representations in parallel for all input and output positions. In these models,\\nthe number of operations required to relate signals from two arbitrary input or output positions grows\\nin the distance between positions, linearly for ConvS2S and logarithmically for ByteNet. This makes\\nit more difficult to learn dependencies between distant positions [ 12]. In the Transformer this is\\nreduced to a constant number of operations, albeit at the cost of reduced effective resolution due\\nto averaging attention-weighted positions, an effect we counteract with Multi-Head Attention as\\ndescribed in section 3.2.\\nSelf-attention, sometimes called intra-attention is an attention mechanism relating different positions\\nof a single sequence in order to compute a representation of the sequence. Self-attention has been\\nused successfully in a variety of tasks including reading comprehension, abstractive summarization,\\ntextual entailment and learning task-independent sentence representations [4, 27, 28, 22].\\nEnd-to-end memory networks are based on a recurrent attention mechanism instead of sequence-\\naligned recurrence and have been shown to perform well on simple-language question answering and\\nlanguage modeling tasks [34].\\nTo the best of our knowledge, however, the Transformer is the first transduction model relying\\nentirely on self-attention to compute representations of its input and output without using sequence-\\naligned RNNs or convolution. In the following sections, we will describe the Transformer, motivate\\nself-attention and discuss its advantages over models such as [17, 18] and [9].\\n3 Model Architecture\\nMost competitive neural sequence transduction models have an encoder-decoder structure [ 5,2,35].\\nHere, the encoder maps an input sequence of symbol representations (x1, ..., x n)to a sequence\\nof continuous representations z= (z1, ..., z n). Given z, the decoder then generates an output\\nsequence (y1, ..., y m)of symbols one element at a time. At each step the model is auto-regressive\\n[10], consuming the previously generated symbols as additional input when generating the next.\\n2Figure 1: The Transformer - model architecture.\\nThe Transformer follows this overall architecture using stacked self-attention and point-wise, fully\\nconnected layers for both the encoder and decoder, shown in the left and right halves of Figure 1,\\nrespectively.\\n3.1 Encoder and Decoder Stacks\\nEncoder: The encoder is composed of a stack of N= 6 identical layers. Each layer has two\\nsub-layers. The first is a multi-head self-attention mechanism, and the second is a simple, position-\\nwise fully connected feed-forward network. We employ a residual connection [ 11] around each of\\nthe two sub-layers, followed by layer normalization [ 1]. That is, the output of each sub-layer is\\nLayerNorm( x+ Sublayer( x)), where Sublayer( x)is the function implemented by the sub-layer\\nitself. To facilitate these residual connections, all sub-layers in the model, as well as the embedding\\nlayers, produce outputs of dimension dmodel = 512 .\\nDecoder: The decoder is also composed of a stack of N= 6identical layers. In addition to the two\\nsub-layers in each encoder layer, the decoder inserts a third sub-layer, which performs multi-head\\nattention over the output of the encoder stack. Similar to the encoder, we employ residual connections\\naround each of the sub-layers, followed by layer normalization. We also modify the self-attention\\nsub-layer in the decoder stack to prevent positions from attending to subsequent positions. This\\nmasking, combined with fact that the output embeddings are offset by one position, ensures that the\\npredictions for position ican depend only on the known outputs at positions less than i.\\n3.2 Attention\\nAn attention function can be described as mapping a query and a set of key-value pairs to an output,\\nwhere the query, keys, values, and output are all vectors. The output is computed as a weighted sum\\n3Scaled Dot-Product Attention\\n Multi-Head Attention\\nFigure 2: (left) Scaled Dot-Product Attention. (right) Multi-Head Attention consists of several\\nattention layers running in parallel.\\nof the values, where the weight assigned to each value is computed by a compatibility function of the\\nquery with the corresponding key.\\n3.2.1 Scaled Dot-Product Attention\\nWe call our particular attention \"Scaled Dot-Product Attention\" (Figure 2). The input consists of\\nqueries and keys of dimension dk, and values of dimension dv. We compute the dot products of the\\nquery with all keys, divide each by√dk, and apply a softmax function to obtain the weights on the\\nvalues.\\nIn practice, we compute the attention function on a set of queries simultaneously, packed together\\ninto a matrix Q. The keys and values are also packed together into matrices KandV. We compute\\nthe matrix of outputs as:\\nAttention( Q, K, V ) = softmax(QKT\\n√dk)V (1)\\nThe two most commonly used attention functions are additive attention [ 2], and dot-product (multi-',\n",

The keys and values are also packed together into matrices KandV. We compute\\nthe matrix of outputs as:\\nAttention( Q, K, V ) = softmax(QKT\\n√dk)V (1)\\nThe two most commonly used attention functions are additive attention [ 2], and dot-product (multi-\\nplicative) attention. Dot-product attention is identical to our algorithm, except for the scaling factor\\nof1√dk. Additive attention computes the compatibility function using a feed-forward network with\\na single hidden layer. While the two are similar in theoretical complexity, dot-product attention is\\nmuch faster and more space-efficient in practice, since it can be implemented using highly optimized\\nmatrix multiplication code.\\nWhile for small values of dkthe two mechanisms perform similarly, additive attention outperforms\\ndot product attention without scaling for larger values of dk[3]. We suspect that for large values of\\ndk, the dot products grow large in magnitude, pushing the softmax function into regions where it has\\nextremely small gradients4. To counteract this effect, we scale the dot products by1√dk.\\n3.2.2 Multi-Head Attention\\nInstead of performing a single attention function with dmodel-dimensional keys, values and queries,\\nwe found it beneficial to linearly project the queries, keys and values htimes with different, learned\\nlinear projections to dk,dkanddvdimensions, respectively. On each of these projected versions of\\nqueries, keys and values we then perform the attention function in parallel, yielding dv-dimensional\\n4To illustrate why the dot products get large, assume that the components of qandkare independent random\\nvariables with mean 0and variance 1. Then their dot product, q·k=Pdk\\ni=1qiki, has mean 0and variance dk.\\n4output values. These are concatenated and once again projected, resulting in the final values, as\\ndepicted in Figure 2.\\nMulti-head attention allows the model to jointly attend to information from different representation\\nsubspaces at different positions. With a single attention head, averaging inhibits this.\\nMultiHead( Q, K, V ) = Concat(head 1, ...,head h)WO\\nwhere head i= Attention( QWQ\\ni, KWK\\ni, V WV\\ni)\\nWhere the projections are parameter matrices WQ\\ni∈Rdmodel×dk,WK\\ni∈Rdmodel×dk,WV\\ni∈Rdmodel×dv\\nandWO∈Rhdv×dmodel.\\nIn this work we employ h= 8 parallel attention layers, or heads. For each of these we use\\ndk=dv=dmodel/h= 64 . Due to the reduced dimension of each head, the total computational cost\\nis similar to that of single-head attention with full dimensionality.\\n3.2.3 Applications of Attention in our Model\\nThe Transformer uses multi-head attention in three different ways:\\n•In \"encoder-decoder attention\" layers, the queries come from the previous decoder layer,\\nand the memory keys and values come from the output of the encoder. This allows every\\nposition in the decoder to attend over all positions in the input sequence. This mimics the\\ntypical encoder-decoder attention mechanisms in sequence-to-sequence models such as\\n[38, 2, 9].\\n•The encoder contains self-attention layers. In a self-attention layer all of the keys, values\\nand queries come from the same place, in this case, the output of the previous layer in the\\nencoder. Each position in the encoder can attend to all positions in the previous layer of the\\nencoder.\\n•Similarly, self-attention layers in the decoder allow each position in the decoder to attend to\\nall positions in the decoder up to and including that position. We need to prevent leftward\\ninformation flow in the decoder to preserve the auto-regressive property. We implement this\\ninside of scaled dot-product attention by masking out (setting to −∞) all values in the input\\nof the softmax which correspond to illegal connections. See Figure 2.\\n3.3 Position-wise Feed-Forward Networks\\nIn addition to attention sub-layers, each of the layers in our encoder and decoder contains a fully\\nconnected feed-forward network, which is applied to each position separately and identically. This\\nconsists of two linear transformations with a ReLU activation in between.\\nFFN( x) = max(0 , xW 1+b1)W2+b2 (2)\\nWhile the linear transformations are the same across different positions, they use different parameters\\nfrom layer to layer. Another way of describing this is as two convolutions with kernel size 1.\\nThe dimensionality of input and output is dmodel = 512 , and the inner-layer has dimensionality\\ndff= 2048 .\\n3.4 Embeddings and Softmax\\nSimilarly to other sequence transduction models, we use learned embeddings to convert the input\\ntokens and output tokens to vectors of dimension dmodel. We also use the usual learned linear transfor-\\nmation and softmax function to convert the decoder output to predicted next-token probabilities. In\\nour model, we share the same weight matrix between the two embedding layers and the pre-softmax\\nlinear transformation, similar to [ 30]. In the embedding layers, we multiply those weights by√dmodel.\\n5Table 1: Maximum path lengths, per-layer complexity and minimum number of sequential operations\\nfor different layer types. nis the sequence length, dis the representation dimension, kis the kernel\\nsize of convolutions and rthe size of the neighborhood in restricted self-attention.\\nLayer Type Complexity per Layer Sequential Maximum Path Length\\nOperations\\nSelf-Attention O(n2·d) O(1) O(1)\\nRecurrent O(n·d2) O(n) O(n)\\nConvolutional O(k·n·d2) O(1) O(logk(n))\\nSelf-Attention (restricted) O(r·n·d) O(1) O(n/r)\\n3.5 Positional Encoding\\nSince our model contains no recurrence and no convolution, in order for the model to make use of the\\norder of the sequence, we must inject some information about the relative or absolute position of the\\ntokens in the sequence. To this end, we add \"positional encodings\" to the input embeddings at the\\nbottoms of the encoder and decoder stacks. The positional encodings have the same dimension dmodel\\nas the embeddings, so that the two can be summed. There are many choices of positional encodings,\\nlearned and fixed [9].\\nIn this work, we use sine and cosine functions of different frequencies:\\nPE(pos,2i)=sin(pos/100002i/d model)\\nPE(pos,2i+1)=cos(pos/100002i/d model)\\nwhere posis the position and iis the dimension. That is, each dimension of the positional encoding\\ncorresponds to a sinusoid. The wavelengths form a geometric progression from 2πto10000 ·2π. We\\nchose this function because we hypothesized it would allow the model to easily learn to attend by\\nrelative positions, since for any fixed offset k,PEpos+kcan be represented as a linear function of\\nPEpos.\\nWe also experimented with using learned positional embeddings [ 9] instead, and found that the two\\nversions produced nearly identical results (see Table 3 row (E)). We chose the sinusoidal version\\nbecause it may allow the model to extrapolate to sequence lengths longer than the ones encountered\\nduring training.\\n4 Why Self-Attention\\nIn this section we compare various aspects of self-attention layers to the recurrent and convolu-\\ntional layers commonly used for mapping one variable-length sequence of symbol representations\\n(x1, ..., x n)to another sequence of equal length (z1, ..., z n), with xi, zi∈Rd, such as a hidden\\nlayer in a typical sequence transduction encoder or decoder. Motivating our use of self-attention we\\nconsider three desiderata.\\nOne is the total computational complexity per layer. Another is the amount of computation that can\\nbe parallelized, as measured by the minimum number of sequential operations required.\\nThe third is the path length between long-range dependencies in the network. Learning long-range\\ndependencies is a key challenge in many sequence transduction tasks. One key factor affecting the\\nability to learn such dependencies is the length of the paths forward and backward signals have to\\ntraverse in the network. The shorter these paths between any combination of positions in the input\\nand output sequences, the easier it is to learn long-range dependencies [ 12]. Hence we also compare\\nthe maximum path length between any two input and output positions in networks composed of the\\ndifferent layer types.\\nAs noted in Table 1, a self-attention layer connects all positions with a constant number of sequentially\\nexecuted operations, whereas a recurrent layer requires O(n)sequential operations. In terms of\\ncomputational complexity, self-attention layers are faster than recurrent layers when the sequence\\n6length nis smaller than the representation dimensionality d, which is most often the case with\\nsentence representations used by state-of-the-art models in machine translations, such as word-piece\\n[38] and byte-pair [ 31] representations. To improve computational performance for tasks involving\\nvery long sequences, self-attention could be restricted to considering only a neighborhood of size rin\\nthe input sequence centered around the respective output position. This would increase the maximum\\npath length to O(n/r). We plan to investigate this approach further in future work.\\nA single convolutional layer with kernel width k < n does not connect all pairs of input and output\\npositions. Doing so requires a stack of O(n/k)convolutional layers in the case of contiguous kernels,\\norO(logk(n))in the case of dilated convolutions [ 18], increasing the length of the longest paths',\n",

Sentences were encoded using byte-pair encoding [ 3], which has a shared source-\\ntarget vocabulary of about 37000 tokens. For English-French, we used the significantly larger WMT\\n2014 English-French dataset consisting of 36M sentences and split tokens into a 32000 word-piece\\nvocabulary [ 38]. Sentence pairs were batched together by approximate sequence length. Each training\\nbatch contained a set of sentence pairs containing approximately 25000 source tokens and 25000\\ntarget tokens.\\n5.2 Hardware and Schedule\\nWe trained our models on one machine with 8 NVIDIA P100 GPUs. For our base models using\\nthe hyperparameters described throughout the paper, each training step took about 0.4 seconds. We\\ntrained the base models for a total of 100,000 steps or 12 hours. For our big models,(described on the\\nbottom line of table 3), step time was 1.0 seconds. The big models were trained for 300,000 steps\\n(3.5 days).\\n5.3 Optimizer\\nWe used the Adam optimizer [ 20] with β1= 0.9,β2= 0.98andϵ= 10−9. We varied the learning\\nrate over the course of training, according to the formula:\\nlrate =d−0.5\\nmodel·min(step_num−0.5, step _num·warmup _steps−1.5) (3)\\nThis corresponds to increasing the learning rate linearly for the first warmup _steps training steps,\\nand decreasing it thereafter proportionally to the inverse square root of the step number. We used\\nwarmup _steps = 4000 .\\n5.4 Regularization\\nWe employ three types of regularization during training:\\n7Table 2: The Transformer achieves better BLEU scores than previous state-of-the-art models on the\\nEnglish-to-German and English-to-French newstest2014 tests at a fraction of the training cost.\\nModelBLEU Training Cost (FLOPs)\\nEN-DE EN-FR EN-DE EN-FR\\nByteNet [18] 23.75\\nDeep-Att + PosUnk [39] 39.2 1.0·1020\\nGNMT + RL [38] 24.6 39.92 2.3·10191.4·1020\\nConvS2S [9] 25.16 40.46 9.6·10181.5·1020\\nMoE [32] 26.03 40.56 2.0·10191.2·1020\\nDeep-Att + PosUnk Ensemble [39] 40.4 8.0·1020\\nGNMT + RL Ensemble [38] 26.30 41.16 1.8·10201.1·1021\\nConvS2S Ensemble [9] 26.36 41.29 7.7·10191.2·1021\\nTransformer (base model) 27.3 38.1 3.3·1018\\nTransformer (big) 28.4 41.8 2.3·1019\\nResidual Dropout We apply dropout [ 33] to the output of each sub-layer, before it is added to the\\nsub-layer input and normalized. In addition, we apply dropout to the sums of the embeddings and the\\npositional encodings in both the encoder and decoder stacks. For the base model, we use a rate of\\nPdrop= 0.1.\\nLabel Smoothing During training, we employed label smoothing of value ϵls= 0.1[36]. This\\nhurts perplexity, as the model learns to be more unsure, but improves accuracy and BLEU score.\\n6 Results\\n6.1 Machine Translation\\nOn the WMT 2014 English-to-German translation task, the big transformer model (Transformer (big)\\nin Table 2) outperforms the best previously reported models (including ensembles) by more than 2.0\\nBLEU, establishing a new state-of-the-art BLEU score of 28.4. The configuration of this model is\\nlisted in the bottom line of Table 3. Training took 3.5days on 8P100 GPUs. Even our base model\\nsurpasses all previously published models and ensembles, at a fraction of the training cost of any of\\nthe competitive models.\\nOn the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task, our big model achieves a BLEU score of 41.0,\\noutperforming all of the previously published single models, at less than 1/4the training cost of the\\nprevious state-of-the-art model. The Transformer (big) model trained for English-to-French used\\ndropout rate Pdrop= 0.1, instead of 0.3.\\nFor the base models, we used a single model obtained by averaging the last 5 checkpoints, which\\nwere written at 10-minute intervals. For the big models, we averaged the last 20 checkpoints. We\\nused beam search with a beam size of 4and length penalty α= 0.6[38]. These hyperparameters\\nwere chosen after experimentation on the development set. We set the maximum output length during\\ninference to input length + 50, but terminate early when possible [38].\\nTable 2 summarizes our results and compares our translation quality and training costs to other model\\narchitectures from the literature. We estimate the number of floating point operations used to train a\\nmodel by multiplying the training time, the number of GPUs used, and an estimate of the sustained\\nsingle-precision floating-point capacity of each GPU5.\\n6.2 Model Variations\\nTo evaluate the importance of different components of the Transformer, we varied our base model\\nin different ways, measuring the change in performance on English-to-German translation on the\\n5We used values of 2.8, 3.7, 6.0 and 9.5 TFLOPS for K80, K40, M40 and P100, respectively.\\n8Table 3: Variations on the Transformer architecture.

We used beam search as described in the previous section, but no\\ncheckpoint averaging. We present these results in Table 3.\\nIn Table 3 rows (A), we vary the number of attention heads and the attention key and value dimensions,\\nkeeping the amount of computation constant, as described in Section 3.2.2. While single-head\\nattention is 0.9 BLEU worse than the best setting, quality also drops off with too many heads.\\nIn Table 3 rows (B), we observe that reducing the attention key size dkhurts model quality. This\\nsuggests that determining compatibility is not easy and that a more sophisticated compatibility\\nfunction than dot product may be beneficial. We further observe in rows (C) and (D) that, as expected,\\nbigger models are better, and dropout is very helpful in avoiding over-fitting. In row (E) we replace our\\nsinusoidal positional encoding with learned positional embeddings [ 9], and observe nearly identical\\nresults to the base model.\\n6.3 English Constituency Parsing\\nTo evaluate if the Transformer can generalize to other tasks we performed experiments on English\\nconstituency parsing. This task presents specific challenges: the output is subject to strong structural\\nconstraints and is significantly longer than the input. Furthermore, RNN sequence-to-sequence\\nmodels have not been able to attain state-of-the-art results in small-data regimes [37].\\nWe trained a 4-layer transformer with dmodel = 1024 on the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) portion of the\\nPenn Treebank [ 25], about 40K training sentences. We also trained it in a semi-supervised setting,\\nusing the larger high-confidence and BerkleyParser corpora from with approximately 17M sentences\\n[37]. We used a vocabulary of 16K tokens for the WSJ only setting and a vocabulary of 32K tokens\\nfor the semi-supervised setting.\\nWe performed only a small number of experiments to select the dropout, both attention and residual\\n(section 5.4), learning rates and beam size on the Section 22 development set, all other parameters\\nremained unchanged from the English-to-German base translation model.

On both WMT 2014 English-to-German and WMT 2014\\nEnglish-to-French translation tasks, we achieve a new state of the art. In the former task our best\\nmodel outperforms even all previously reported ensembles.\\nWe are excited about the future of attention-based models and plan to apply them to other tasks. We\\nplan to extend the Transformer to problems involving input and output modalities other than text and\\nto investigate local, restricted attention mechanisms to efficiently handle large inputs and outputs\\nsuch as images, audio and video. Making generation less sequential is another research goals of ours.\\nThe code we used to train and evaluate our models is available at https://github.com/\\ntensorflow/tensor2tensor .\\nAcknowledgements We are grateful to Nal Kalchbrenner and Stephan Gouws for their fruitful\\ncomments, corrections and inspiration.\\nReferences\\n[1]Jimmy Lei Ba, Jamie Ryan Kiros, and Geoffrey E Hinton.

They may not know what the components are, where they came from, or \\nhow they were put together. People just expect their machines and devices to work. And they do work, thanks to \\nelectronics manufacturers.  \\nOur lives and our communities depend on electronics. And that reliance is only going to grow as systems become \\nsmarter. We are moving toward a world of self-driving vehicles, immersive virtual experiences, and automated \\nenvironments. All of these innovations will be fueled by electronics manufacturers. \\nIn addition to influencing how we live, work, and play on a daily basis, electronics manufacturers comprise a \\nsignificant component of the nation’s industrial base. To update and deepen our knowledge of the industry, IPC \\nworked with INFORUM (Interindustry Forecasting at the University of Maryland) to measure the contributions of \\nelectronics manufacturers to the U.S. economy. \\nAt each step of the electronics manufacturing supply chain, workers earn compensation, and value is added to \\nthe national economy. In addition to these direct impacts, electronics manufacturers also purchase goods and \\nservices from other domestic industries, generating indirect economic activity in those industries. Likewise, \\nemployees in the electronics manufacturing sector spend their earnings on groceries, services, and consumer \\ngoods, and those induced benefits help local and national economies in additional ways. \\nThese direct, indirect and induced effects can be measured across employment, income, output, and contribution \\nto economic growth. These are the tangible economic benefits of electronics manufacturing in the United States. \\nHowever, there are intangible benefits that are equally meaningful. It’s the connection you feel when you reach \\na loved one on the phone, no matter where they are. The security you feel driving a vehicle with cutting-edge \\nsafety features. The laughter you enjoy watching the latest comedy on your connected television – or on your \\ntablet while away from home.

In the United States, IPC represents more \\nthan 2,700 member-company sites across a diverse collection of industries that are integral parts of the economy. \\nIn addition to summarizing the industry’s direct effects, such as output and labor income, this report provides a \\nmore comprehensive view of electronics manufacturing’s economic contributions.\\nWhen electronics manufacturers purchase services and goods from other sectors to use as inputs in the products \\nthey design and build, they produce economic activity in those sectors. The economic impact created in these \\nsupply chains are called indirect effects. \\nLikewise, employees in the electronics manufacturing sector and related supply chains spend their earnings \\nin downstream sectors, which, in turn, produces a range of economic activities at the local and national levels. \\nThese economic contributions are called induced effects. The total economic contribution of the electronics \\nmanufacturing sector includes these direct, indirect and induced effects.1\\nThis report finds:   \\n• Direct Effects: In the United States, electronics manufacturers directly employ more than 1.3 million workers, \\ncontribute $165.7 billion in labor income and $307.6 billion to GDP , and produce nearly $710 billion in output. \\nThe electronics manufacturing sector plays a vital role in the national economy, accounting for 1.6 percent of \\nGDP and 0.7 percent of jobs. \\n• Indirect and Induced Effects: Including both indirect and induced effects, U.S. electronics manufacturers \\nsupport nearly 5.3 million U.S. jobs, contribute almost $408 billion in labor income each year and $714 \\nbillion to U.S. GDP , and produce $1.46 trillion in output (see Table ES-1). The direct, indirect and induced \\neconomic activity of the electronics manufacturing sector accounts for 3.7 percent of U.S. GDP and 2.8 \\npercent of U.S. jobs. \\nTable ES-1.

Appendix B provides estimated impacts through 2019.5\\nThe Economic Impacts of the  U.S. Electronics Manufacturing Sector• Multiplier Effects: The electronics manufacturing industry has an impactful “multiplier effect.” That is, every \\none electronics manufacturing job in the U.S. helps support over three additional jobs in the U.S. economy. \\nLikewise, every dollar in labor income in U.S. electronics manufacturing produces another $1.46 in other \\nsectors of the economy. Every dollar added to U.S. GDP by the electronics manufacturing sector creates \\n$1.32 elsewhere in the economy. Additionally, every dollar in electronics manufacturing output generates \\n$1.05 of output elsewhere in the economy.\\n• State-Level Employment: The economic impact of the electronics manufacturing sector is important in many \\nindividual states. Ten states have more than 100,000 workers each because of the electronics manufacturing \\nsector. California’s electronics manufacturers directly and indirectly employ more than 942,000 employees, \\nfollowed by Texas (437,400), Massachusetts (160,000), New York (156,000) and Florida (137,000). The sector’s \\ndirect employment in these five states is nearly 554,000, not to mention an additional 1.2 million indirect and \\ninduced jobs (See Figure ES-1). \\nFigure ES-1.

(See Section 4 for definitions of these terms.) \\n• Intermediate Goods Supplier to Other Industries: The U.S. electronics manufacturing sector is an important \\nintermediary supplier for other key industries in the United States. The aerospace industry sources nearly \\n$26 billion in intermediate goods from the electronics manufacturing sector — roughly 11.3 percent of all \\naerospace sector intermediate expenditures. The auto industry sources nearly $20 billion in intermediate \\ngoods from the U.S. electronics manufacturing sector, representing 2.7 percent of the automotive sector’s \\nintermediate purchases.\\n• Capital Equipment for Other Sectors: Sectors in the economy purchase capital equipment and make \\ninvestment expenditures in order to produce goods and services. Many of these sectors rely heavily on \\nequipment produced by electronics manufacturers. The medical services industry sources $23.3 billion \\nof equipment from the electronics manufacturing sector, nearly 22 percent of the sector’s total annual \\ninvestment. The aerospace industry sources nearly $1.3 billion in equipment, which is approximately 15.6 \\npercent of total aerospace equipment investment spending. And the auto industry sources about $1.4 billion, \\nroughly 7.6 percent of the automotive sector’s total equipment investment expenditures. 7\\nThe Economic Impacts of the  U.S. Electronics Manufacturing Sector1. INTRODUCTION\\nThe electronics manufacturing sector is a vibrant and dynamic segment of the U.S. economy, with a long \\nhistory of innovation and resiliency dating back to Lee de Forest’s 1906 invention of the three-element vacuum \\ntube. The 1940s brought the introduction of semiconductors, which spawned the modern era of computing and \\ntelecommunications. \\nToday the electronics manufacturing sector is the heart of innovation in every sector of the economy. \\nSmartphones are allowing individuals to connect instantly with friends and family anywhere in the world or order \\ngroceries for home delivery. Robots are transforming warehouse and delivery industries. Cutting-edge medical \\ndiagnostic equipment is saving and improving lives. Electronics manufacturers are empowering the next wave of \\nelectric vehicles, autonomous robots, and top-secret defense technologies.  \\nThe electronics manufacturing sector includes such household names as Apple, Bosch, DuPont, Foxconn, GE \\nMedical Systems, Honeywell, IBM, Intel, Jabil, Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman, and Raytheon. However, 80 \\npercent of U.S. electronics manufacturers are small and medium-sized businesses. Economic activities by these \\ncompanies drive innovation, output and jobs in adjacent industries such as aerospace, automotive, medical and \\ndefense.   \\nThis study finds that the electronics manufacturing sector directly contributes roughly $308 billion to U.S. GDP \\nand employs over 1.3 million U.S. workers. The electronics manufacturing sector accounts for 1.6 percent of \\nU.S. GDP and 0.7 percent of U.S. jobs. Electronics manufacturing activity, however, does not exist in isolation. \\nIncluding both indirect and induced effects, U.S. electronics manufacturers support nearly 5.3 million jobs, \\ncontribute almost $408 billion in labor income each year, add $714 billion to GDP , and produce $1.46 trillion in \\noutput. The direct, indirect and induced economic activity of the electronics manufacturing sector accounts for 3.7 \\npercent of U.S. GDP and 2.8 percent of U.S. jobs. \\nThe following section describes the methodology used to estimate these impacts. Section 3 provides quantitative \\nresults showing electronics manufacturing’s contribution at the national and state levels. Section 4 provides \\na quantitative analysis of where the output of U.S. electronics manufacturers goes. Appendix A contains Fact \\nSheets for the entire United States and the top 16 U.S. states ranked by output of electronics manufacturing. 8\\nINTERCONNECTING AMERICA’S ECONOMY: 2. METHODOLOGY AND KEY TERMS\\nThis study defines electronics manufacturing to include the following diverse industries in the North American \\nIndustry Classification System (NAICS):\\n• NAICS 3341 - Computer and Peripheral Equipment Manufacturing\\n• NAICS 3342 - Communications Equipment Manufacturing\\n• NAICS 3343 - Audio and Video Equipment Manufacturing\\n• NAICS 3344 - Semiconductor and Other Electronic Component Manufacturing\\n• NAICS 3345 - Navigational, Measuring, Electromedical, and Control Instruments Manufacturing\\n• NAICS 3353 – Electrical Equipment Manufacturing\\n• NAICS 3359 - Other Electrical Equipment and Component Manufacturing\\n• NAICS 33632 - Motor Vehicle Electrical and Electronic Equipment Manufacturing\\nThe calculated economic impacts presented in this study use input-output (IO) analysis to quantify the \\ninterdependencies that exist between different sectors of the economy. IO analysis can be used to estimate chains \\nof effects that occur through the interrelationships among businesses, government and households. In this way, \\nIO analysis enables an examination of interindustry relationships within an economy and, in turn, can characterize \\nthe effects of a change in one sector on the broader economy. This analysis uses the 2017 IMPLAN database and \\nmodel. All economic impacts are in inflation-adjusted 2017 dollars (2017$). All results are for calendar year 2017. \\nThe three types of economic impacts we derive in this study are:\\n• Direct Impacts—Activity generated within the focus industry. In this case, electronics manufacturing activity \\nserves as the direct impact.\\n• Indirect Impacts—Activity generated in other industries as a result of purchases (materials, energy and \\nservices) by the focus industry through the supply chain. For example, an automobile manufacturing firm \\nmight purchase tires, steel and electrical components to produce its final product.\\n• Induced Impacts—Activity generated by purchases of households from income earned from direct and \\nindirect production. \\nThis report provides estimates for the direct, indirect, and induced impacts on:\\n• Employment — Employment is the people employed by an industry. Employment figures use the Bureau \\nof Economic Analysis (BEA) and Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) full-time/part-time annual average for a \\ngiven industry. The data covers both wage and salary employees and those who are self-employed.\\n• Labor Income — Labor income, a component of value added, is the sum of salary/wages and supplements. \\nSupplements may take the form of employer contributions for employee pensions and insurance funds \\n(such as health insurance). This measure also includes proprietor income.\\n• Value Added — Value added is the industry’s contribution to GDP and represents the enhancement a \\nmanufacturer provides (e.g., assembly) to a product before offering it to the end consumer. Put another \\nway, value added is the difference between total revenue of an industry and the cost of intermediate \\ninputs. Components of value added include employee labor compensation, taxes on production and \\nimports, and gross operating surplus (including profits).\\n• Output — Output, in economic terms, refers to the total value of all goods and services produced by an \\nindustry. This includes both intermediate demand (sales of intermediate inputs to other industries) and \\nfinal demand.9\\nThe Economic Impacts of the  U.S. Electronics Manufacturing SectorIO analysis utilizes tables that show the interrelationships between industries. Looking down the column of a \\ntable, we see all the inputs of other industries used to produce that industry’s product. Looking across the row \\nof a table, we see the industries and final uses that industry sells to. We use these tables to calculate the indirect \\nimpacts of a given industry’s production.\\nEach analysis presented in this report focuses on a region, such as the United States or one state, and examines \\nthe total contributions of the electronics manufacturing sector in that region. \\nMeasures of output include double-counting. For example, the tire used to build a motor vehicle is counted both \\nas output of tires and as output of motor vehicles. This is important only if both are produced in the same region. \\nHowever, employment, labor income and value added are additive, that is to say, not double-counted. Many slices \\nof value added contribute to the final value of a product or service.\\nIn addition to analyzing the economic contribution at the national level, this report also quantifies electronics',\n",

Output and jobs are also supported in supplier (“indirect”) industries \\nthat provide components, materials, energy and various services to the electronics manufacturing sector. \\nAdditionally, individuals employed by electronics manufacturers and related suppliers earn income, a portion \\nof which is used to purchase consumer goods and services, creating jobs and output in other industries. These \\neconomic impacts are known as “induced” effects.\\nTable 2 summarizes the sector’s direct, indirect, and induced impacts in employment, labor income, value added, \\nand output. Electronics manufacturers directly employ over 1.3 million people, generate over $307 billion in value \\nadded and contribute nearly $710 billion in output. This can be seen in the first row of Table 2. \\nIn total, electronics manufacturing activity helps support 5.3 million  \\njobs and $714 billion in value added to the national economy.\\nDirect economic activity by the electronics manufacturing sector also generates economic activity throughout \\nother sectors of the country, as shown on the second row of Table 2. As a of result of annual economic activity by \\nelectronics manufacturers, upstream suppliers generate over $340 billion in output and employ nearly 1.5 million \\npeople. The supply chain adds $176.6 billion to GDP as a result of economic activity by electronics manufacturers. \\nFinally, a portion of the labor income earned by workers in electronics manufacturing and related suppliers is \\nspent on goods and services in other sectors of the economy.

END-USE ANALYSIS\\nSection 3 described the upstream supply-chain effects of the electronics manufacturing industry. Section 4 \\nchanges focus and addresses where manufactured electronics ultimately end up. This report describes five types \\nof end use as well as the total category:\\n1. Personal Consumption Expenditures — These are goods and services purchased by individuals for \\nprivate use.\\n2. Investment & Inventory Change — Investment includes all purchases of equipment, structures, and \\nintellectual property purchased by private businesses. Inventory change describes the change in physical \\nvolume of inventories owned by businesses from one period to another.\\n3. Government: Federal Defense — This category includes both consumption expenditures and investment \\nmade by the federal government for defense purposes.\\n4. Government: All Other — The remainder of government activity is contained in this category. It includes all \\nnon-defense expenditures at the federal, state and local levels.\\n5. Exports — Exports are goods and services sold by domestic businesses to foreign individuals, private \\nbusinesses and governments.\\n6. Final Sales — This is defined as the sum of personal consumption expenditures, investment and inventory \\nchange, government spending and exports.\\nThe impacts presented show the electronics manufacturing content in all categories of final sales. This would \\ninclude, for example, semiconductors in personal motor vehicles or electronic components in communication \\nequipment or in other defense-related equipment bought by the U.S. Defense Department.\\nIn total, the electronics manufacturing industry is \\nresponsible for over $1.0 trillion in content of final sales. \\nGiven their wide variety of applications, electronic goods are well represented in each of the categories listed \\nabove. Figure 9 illustrates the total end-use content by each of these five categories. Investment and inventory \\nchange account for the greatest share, making up 40.9 percent ($426.6 billion) of the total. The next largest share \\nof electronic goods, 29.4 percent ($306.5 billion), end up in personal consumption expenditures. Finally, exports \\n($223.9 billion; 21.5 percent), federal defense ($37.8 billion; 3.6 percent) and other government purchases ($48.1 \\nbillion; 4.6 percent) make up the remainder. In total, the electronics manufacturing industry is responsible for over \\n$1.0 trillion in content of final sales.22\\nINTERCONNECTING AMERICA’S ECONOMY: Figure 9. End-Use Impacts Summary \\nUnits: Billion $ \\nTable 9 provides additional details on end uses in the electronics manufacturing industry’s sub-sectors. Most \\nof these sub-sectors share the characteristics of the overall sector, with investment and inventory change \\ncomprising the bulk of the total, and personal consumption expenditures ranking second.

These inputs are goods and services required to produce the product which is ultimately sold to final-\\ndemand markets.   \\nTable 16 and Figure 13 show purchases of intermediate electronic inputs in the automotive sector in 2017. \\nWithin this sector, the automobiles and motor vehicle parts industries comprised the vast majority of \\nintermediate expenditures of electronic goods. In both of these sub-sectors, the main inputs being purchased are \\nsemiconductors and other electronic components (NAICS 3344). Purchases of IPC-related goods accounted for \\nroughly 2.7 percent of the automotive sector’s intermediate purchases.\\nTable 17 and Figure 14 show purchases of intermediate electronic inputs by the aerospace sector. The aircraft \\nsub-sector spent over $14 billion on such purchases in 2017, and the overall sector spent close to $26 billion. IPC-\\nrelated products comprised 11.3 percent of all aerospace sector intermediate expenditures in 2017.\\nFinally, Table 18 and Figure 15 display purchases of intermediate electronic inputs by the medical services \\nsector in 2017. The aggregate medical services sector spends in excess of $10 billion in intermediate purchases \\nof electronics.

CONCLUSIONS \\nThe electronics manufacturing sector fills many critical roles in the U.S. economy, and in dozens of adjacent \\nindustries, including transportation, aerospace and defense, and medical services, among many others. \\nWhile its goods and services are generally hidden out of sight, the industry designs, builds, tests, and services \\nthousands of intermediate and final products used billions of times per day by consumers around the world. \\nThe many positive economic impacts of electronics manufacturing in the United States include millions of jobs, \\nand hundreds of billions of dollars’ worth of labor income and value-added. \\nThe benefits are most pronounced in 16 states that account for approximately 80 percent of national electronics \\nmanufacturing output; but the benefits are also generated in and shared across all 50 states and U.S territories.\\nAnd while this report does not delve into the implications of this industry’s value to the economy, it is clear that \\nthe industry has thrived in the United States due to that nation’s longtime strengths in education, workforce, \\nresearch, innovation, and business environment. \\nTo the extent those historic strengths may be at risk in today’s world, the United States risks its future world \\nleadership and prosperity. Leaders in United States and all nations who are interested in future prosperity should \\ngive high priority to creating a positive policy and business environment for the electronics manufacturing \\nindustry. \\nIPC will continue to foster and promote industry standards to help ensure superior quality of electronics products \\nand services, environmentally friendly operations, and intellectual property protection. We will continue to \\noperate the industry’s leading training and worker certifications to help provide the workforce of today and \\ntomorrow. We will conduct and publish unique industry research to help all parties make more informed \\ndecisions. And we will continue to advocate for pro-growth, pro-innovation, science-based policies in all nations.\\n 33\\nThe Economic Impacts of the  U.S. Electronics Manufacturing SectorAPPENDIX A – NATIONAL AND STATE FACT SHEETS\\nAppendix A contains Fact Sheets which summarize information for the entire United States and 16 specific states. \\nAll data was sourced from IMPLAN and applies to the year 2017. \\nFact Sheets are provided for the following states: \\n1. Arizona\\n2. California\\n3. Colorado\\n4. Florida\\n5. Illinois\\n6. Massachusetts7. Michigan\\n8. Minnesota\\n9. New Jersey\\n10. New York\\n11. North Carolina\\n12. Ohio13. Oregon\\n14. Pennsylvania\\n15. Texas\\n16. Wisconsin\\nAt the top of each fact sheet are general facts about the region. These pertain to the entire economy, helping to \\ngive perspective to the electronics manufacturing impacts listed underneath. \\nThe second block summarizes the industry’s direct economic effects in terms of employment, labor income, value \\nadded, and output. The chart also shows electronics manufacturing’s share of regional GDP , calculated by dividing \\ndirect value-added by the gross regional product. Labor income per worker is derived by dividing electronics \\nmanufacturing labor income by employment.\\nThe third block in each table describes electronics manufacturing’s direct impacts, the impacts of upstream \\nsuppliers (indirect), and associated income-related (induced) effects.\\nNext, two different multipliers are provided. Economic multipliers describe the ratio of the sum of indirect and \\ninduced impacts to direct impacts. For employment multipliers, take the sum of indirect and induced employment \\nand divide it by direct employment. Similarly, output multipliers can be calculated by adding indirect and induced \\noutput together and dividing it by direct output.\\n 34\\nINTERCONNECTING AMERICA’S ECONOMY: Fact Sheet 1.

       " Document(page_content='1 Introduction\\nRecurrent neural networks, long short-term memory [ 13] and gated recurrent [ 7] neural networks\\nin particular, have been firmly established as state of the art approaches in sequence modeling and\\ntransduction problems such as language modeling and machine translation [ 35,2,5]. Numerous\\nefforts have since continued to push the boundaries of recurrent language models and encoder-decoder\\narchitectures [38, 24, 15].\\nRecurrent models typically factor computation along the symbol positions of the input and output\\nsequences. Aligning the positions to steps in computation time, they generate a sequence of hidden\\nstates ht, as a function of the previous hidden state ht−1and the input for position t. This inherently\\nsequential nature precludes parallelization within training examples, which becomes critical at longer\\nsequence lengths, as memory constraints limit batching across examples. Recent work has achieved\\nsignificant improvements in computational efficiency through factorization tricks [ 21] and conditional\\ncomputation [ 32], while also improving model performance in case of the latter. The fundamental\\nconstraint of sequential computation, however, remains.\\nAttention mechanisms have become an integral part of compelling sequence modeling and transduc-\\ntion models in various tasks, allowing modeling of dependencies without regard to their distance in\\nthe input or output sequences [ 2,19]. In all but a few cases [ 27], however, such attention mechanisms\\nare used in conjunction with a recurrent network.\\nIn this work we propose the Transformer, a model architecture eschewing recurrence and instead\\nrelying entirely on an attention mechanism to draw global dependencies between input and output.\\nThe Transformer allows for significantly more parallelization and can reach a new state of the art in\\ntranslation quality after being trained for as little as twelve hours on eight P100 GPUs.\\n2 Background\\nThe goal of reducing sequential computation also forms the foundation of the Extended Neural GPU\\n[16], ByteNet [ 18] and ConvS2S [ 9], all of which use convolutional neural networks as basic building\\nblock, computing hidden representations in parallel for all input and output positions. In these models,\\nthe number of operations required to relate signals from two arbitrary input or output positions grows\\nin the distance between positions, linearly for ConvS2S and logarithmically for ByteNet. This makes\\nit more difficult to learn dependencies between distant positions [ 12]. In the Transformer this is\\nreduced to a constant number of operations, albeit at the cost of reduced effective resolution due\\nto averaging attention-weighted positions, an effect we counteract with Multi-Head Attention as\\ndescribed in section 3.2.\\nSelf-attention, sometimes called intra-attention is an attention mechanism relating different positions\\nof a single sequence in order to compute a representation of the sequence. Self-attention has been\\nused successfully in a variety of tasks including reading comprehension, abstractive summarization,\\ntextual entailment and learning task-independent sentence representations [4, 27, 28, 22].\\nEnd-to-end memory networks are based on a recurrent attention mechanism instead of sequence-\\naligned recurrence and have been shown to perform well on simple-language question answering and\\nlanguage modeling tasks [34].\\nTo the best of our knowledge, however, the Transformer is the first transduction model relying\\nentirely on self-attention to compute representations of its input and output without using sequence-\\naligned RNNs or convolution. In the following sections, we will describe the Transformer, motivate\\nself-attention and discuss its advantages over models such as [17, 18] and [9].\\n3 Model Architecture\\nMost competitive neural sequence transduction models have an encoder-decoder structure [ 5,2,35].\\nHere, the encoder maps an input sequence of symbol representations (x1, ..., x n)to a sequence\\nof continuous representations z= (z1, ..., z n). Given z, the decoder then generates an output\\nsequence (y1, ..., y m)of symbols one element at a time. At each step the model is auto-regressive\\n[10], consuming the previously generated symbols as additional input when generating the next.\\n2', metadata={'source': 'C:\\\\Users\\\\vishnu.singh\\\\Downloads\\\\NLP PRACTISE\\\\pdf\\\\attention_you_need.pdf', 'page': 1}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='Figure 1: The Transformer - model architecture.\\nThe Transformer follows this overall architecture using stacked self-attention and point-wise, fully\\nconnected layers for both the encoder and decoder, shown in the left and right halves of Figure 1,\\nrespectively.\\n3.1 Encoder and Decoder Stacks\\nEncoder: The encoder is composed of a stack of N= 6 identical layers. Each layer has two\\nsub-layers. The first is a multi-head self-attention mechanism, and the second is a simple, position-\\nwise fully connected feed-forward network. We employ a residual connection [ 11] around each of\\nthe two sub-layers, followed by layer normalization [ 1]. That is, the output of each sub-layer is\\nLayerNorm( x+ Sublayer( x)), where Sublayer( x)is the function implemented by the sub-layer\\nitself. To facilitate these residual connections, all sub-layers in the model, as well as the embedding\\nlayers, produce outputs of dimension dmodel = 512 .\\nDecoder: The decoder is also composed of a stack of N= 6identical layers. In addition to the two\\nsub-layers in each encoder layer, the decoder inserts a third sub-layer, which performs multi-head\\nattention over the output of the encoder stack. Similar to the encoder, we employ residual connections\\naround each of the sub-layers, followed by layer normalization. We also modify the self-attention\\nsub-layer in the decoder stack to prevent positions from attending to subsequent positions. This\\nmasking, combined with fact that the output embeddings are offset by one position, ensures that the\\npredictions for position ican depend only on the known outputs at positions less than i.\\n3.2 Attention\\nAn attention function can be described as mapping a query and a set of key-value pairs to an output,\\nwhere the query, keys, values, and output are all vectors. The output is computed as a weighted sum\\n3', metadata={'source': 'C:\\\\Users\\\\vishnu.singh\\\\Downloads\\\\NLP PRACTISE\\\\pdf\\\\attention_you_need.pdf', 'page': 2}),\n",

The input consists of\\nqueries and keys of dimension dk, and values of dimension dv. We compute the dot products of the\\nquery with all keys, divide each by√dk, and apply a softmax function to obtain the weights on the\\nvalues.\\nIn practice, we compute the attention function on a set of queries simultaneously, packed together\\ninto a matrix Q. The keys and values are also packed together into matrices KandV. We compute\\nthe matrix of outputs as:\\nAttention( Q, K, V ) = softmax(QKT\\n√dk)V (1)\\nThe two most commonly used attention functions are additive attention [ 2], and dot-product (multi-\\nplicative) attention. Dot-product attention is identical to our algorithm, except for the scaling factor\\nof1√dk. Additive attention computes the compatibility function using a feed-forward network with\\na single hidden layer. While the two are similar in theoretical complexity, dot-product attention is\\nmuch faster and more space-efficient in practice, since it can be implemented using highly optimized\\nmatrix multiplication code.\\nWhile for small values of dkthe two mechanisms perform similarly, additive attention outperforms\\ndot product attention without scaling for larger values of dk[3]. We suspect that for large values of\\ndk, the dot products grow large in magnitude, pushing the softmax function into regions where it has\\nextremely small gradients4. To counteract this effect, we scale the dot products by1√dk.\\n3.2.2 Multi-Head Attention\\nInstead of performing a single attention function with dmodel-dimensional keys, values and queries,\\nwe found it beneficial to linearly project the queries, keys and values htimes with different, learned\\nlinear projections to dk,dkanddvdimensions, respectively.

For each of these we use\\ndk=dv=dmodel/h= 64 . Due to the reduced dimension of each head, the total computational cost\\nis similar to that of single-head attention with full dimensionality.\\n3.2.3 Applications of Attention in our Model\\nThe Transformer uses multi-head attention in three different ways:\\n•In \"encoder-decoder attention\" layers, the queries come from the previous decoder layer,\\nand the memory keys and values come from the output of the encoder. This allows every\\nposition in the decoder to attend over all positions in the input sequence. This mimics the\\ntypical encoder-decoder attention mechanisms in sequence-to-sequence models such as\\n[38, 2, 9].\\n•The encoder contains self-attention layers. In a self-attention layer all of the keys, values\\nand queries come from the same place, in this case, the output of the previous layer in the\\nencoder. Each position in the encoder can attend to all positions in the previous layer of the\\nencoder.\\n•Similarly, self-attention layers in the decoder allow each position in the decoder to attend to\\nall positions in the decoder up to and including that position. We need to prevent leftward\\ninformation flow in the decoder to preserve the auto-regressive property. We implement this\\ninside of scaled dot-product attention by masking out (setting to −∞) all values in the input\\nof the softmax which correspond to illegal connections. See Figure 2.\\n3.3 Position-wise Feed-Forward Networks\\nIn addition to attention sub-layers, each of the layers in our encoder and decoder contains a fully\\nconnected feed-forward network, which is applied to each position separately and identically. This\\nconsists of two linear transformations with a ReLU activation in between.\\nFFN( x) = max(0 , xW 1+b1)W2+b2 (2)\\nWhile the linear transformations are the same across different positions, they use different parameters\\nfrom layer to layer. Another way of describing this is as two convolutions with kernel size 1.\\nThe dimensionality of input and output is dmodel = 512 , and the inner-layer has dimensionality\\ndff= 2048 .\\n3.4 Embeddings and Softmax\\nSimilarly to other sequence transduction models, we use learned embeddings to convert the input\\ntokens and output tokens to vectors of dimension dmodel. We also use the usual learned linear transfor-\\nmation and softmax function to convert the decoder output to predicted next-token probabilities. In\\nour model, we share the same weight matrix between the two embedding layers and the pre-softmax\\nlinear transformation, similar to [ 30]. In the embedding layers, we multiply those weights by√dmodel.\\n5', metadata={'source': 'C:\\\\Users\\\\vishnu.singh\\\\Downloads\\\\NLP PRACTISE\\\\pdf\\\\attention_you_need.pdf', 'page': 4}),\n",

To this end, we add \"positional encodings\" to the input embeddings at the\\nbottoms of the encoder and decoder stacks. The positional encodings have the same dimension dmodel\\nas the embeddings, so that the two can be summed. There are many choices of positional encodings,\\nlearned and fixed [9].\\nIn this work, we use sine and cosine functions of different frequencies:\\nPE(pos,2i)=sin(pos/100002i/d model)\\nPE(pos,2i+1)=cos(pos/100002i/d model)\\nwhere posis the position and iis the dimension. That is, each dimension of the positional encoding\\ncorresponds to a sinusoid. The wavelengths form a geometric progression from 2πto10000 ·2π. We\\nchose this function because we hypothesized it would allow the model to easily learn to attend by\\nrelative positions, since for any fixed offset k,PEpos+kcan be represented as a linear function of\\nPEpos.\\nWe also experimented with using learned positional embeddings [ 9] instead, and found that the two\\nversions produced nearly identical results (see Table 3 row (E)). We chose the sinusoidal version\\nbecause it may allow the model to extrapolate to sequence lengths longer than the ones encountered\\nduring training.\\n4 Why Self-Attention\\nIn this section we compare various aspects of self-attention layers to the recurrent and convolu-\\ntional layers commonly used for mapping one variable-length sequence of symbol representations\\n(x1, ..., x n)to another sequence of equal length (z1, ..., z n), with xi, zi∈Rd, such as a hidden\\nlayer in a typical sequence transduction encoder or decoder. Motivating our use of self-attention we\\nconsider three desiderata.\\nOne is the total computational complexity per layer. Another is the amount of computation that can\\nbe parallelized, as measured by the minimum number of sequential operations required.\\nThe third is the path length between long-range dependencies in the network. Learning long-range\\ndependencies is a key challenge in many sequence transduction tasks. One key factor affecting the\\nability to learn such dependencies is the length of the paths forward and backward signals have to\\ntraverse in the network. The shorter these paths between any combination of positions in the input\\nand output sequences, the easier it is to learn long-range dependencies [ 12]. Hence we also compare\\nthe maximum path length between any two input and output positions in networks composed of the\\ndifferent layer types.\\nAs noted in Table 1, a self-attention layer connects all positions with a constant number of sequentially\\nexecuted operations, whereas a recurrent layer requires O(n)sequential operations. In terms of\\ncomputational complexity, self-attention layers are faster than recurrent layers when the sequence\\n6', metadata={'source': 'C:\\\\Users\\\\vishnu.singh\\\\Downloads\\\\NLP PRACTISE\\\\pdf\\\\attention_you_need.pdf', 'page': 5}),\n",

To improve computational performance for tasks involving\\nvery long sequences, self-attention could be restricted to considering only a neighborhood of size rin\\nthe input sequence centered around the respective output position. This would increase the maximum\\npath length to O(n/r). We plan to investigate this approach further in future work.\\nA single convolutional layer with kernel width k < n does not connect all pairs of input and output\\npositions. Doing so requires a stack of O(n/k)convolutional layers in the case of contiguous kernels,\\norO(logk(n))in the case of dilated convolutions [ 18], increasing the length of the longest paths\\nbetween any two positions in the network. Convolutional layers are generally more expensive than\\nrecurrent layers, by a factor of k. Separable convolutions [ 6], however, decrease the complexity\\nconsiderably, to O(k·n·d+n·d2). Even with k=n, however, the complexity of a separable\\nconvolution is equal to the combination of a self-attention layer and a point-wise feed-forward layer,\\nthe approach we take in our model.\\nAs side benefit, self-attention could yield more interpretable models. We inspect attention distributions\\nfrom our models and present and discuss examples in the appendix. Not only do individual attention\\nheads clearly learn to perform different tasks, many appear to exhibit behavior related to the syntactic\\nand semantic structure of the sentences.\\n5 Training\\nThis section describes the training regime for our models.\\n5.1 Training Data and Batching\\nWe trained on the standard WMT 2014 English-German dataset consisting of about 4.5 million\\nsentence pairs. Sentences were encoded using byte-pair encoding [ 3], which has a shared source-\\ntarget vocabulary of about 37000 tokens. For English-French, we used the significantly larger WMT\\n2014 English-French dataset consisting of 36M sentences and split tokens into a 32000 word-piece\\nvocabulary [ 38]. Sentence pairs were batched together by approximate sequence length. Each training\\nbatch contained a set of sentence pairs containing approximately 25000 source tokens and 25000\\ntarget tokens.\\n5.2 Hardware and Schedule\\nWe trained our models on one machine with 8 NVIDIA P100 GPUs. For our base models using\\nthe hyperparameters described throughout the paper, each training step took about 0.4 seconds. We\\ntrained the base models for a total of 100,000 steps or 12 hours. For our big models,(described on the\\nbottom line of table 3), step time was 1.0 seconds. The big models were trained for 300,000 steps\\n(3.5 days).\\n5.3 Optimizer\\nWe used the Adam optimizer [ 20] with β1= 0.9,β2= 0.98andϵ= 10−9. We varied the learning\\nrate over the course of training, according to the formula:\\nlrate =d−0.5\\nmodel·min(step_num−0.5, step _num·warmup _steps−1.5) (3)\\nThis corresponds to increasing the learning rate linearly for the first warmup _steps training steps,\\nand decreasing it thereafter proportionally to the inverse square root of the step number. We used\\nwarmup _steps = 4000 .\\n5.4 Regularization\\nWe employ three types of regularization during training:\\n7', metadata={'source': 'C:\\\\Users\\\\vishnu.singh\\\\Downloads\\\\NLP PRACTISE\\\\pdf\\\\attention_you_need.pdf', 'page': 6}),\n",

Even our base model\\nsurpasses all previously published models and ensembles, at a fraction of the training cost of any of\\nthe competitive models.\\nOn the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task, our big model achieves a BLEU score of 41.0,\\noutperforming all of the previously published single models, at less than 1/4the training cost of the\\nprevious state-of-the-art model. The Transformer (big) model trained for English-to-French used\\ndropout rate Pdrop= 0.1, instead of 0.3.\\nFor the base models, we used a single model obtained by averaging the last 5 checkpoints, which\\nwere written at 10-minute intervals. For the big models, we averaged the last 20 checkpoints. We\\nused beam search with a beam size of 4and length penalty α= 0.6[38]. These hyperparameters\\nwere chosen after experimentation on the development set. We set the maximum output length during\\ninference to input length + 50, but terminate early when possible [38].\\nTable 2 summarizes our results and compares our translation quality and training costs to other model\\narchitectures from the literature.

We\\nplan to extend the Transformer to problems involving input and output modalities other than text and\\nto investigate local, restricted attention mechanisms to efficiently handle large inputs and outputs\\nsuch as images, audio and video.

       " Document(page_content='INTERCONNECTING AMERICA’S ECONOMY: FOREWORD\\nSir Arthur Charles Clarke wrote, “Any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable \\nfrom magic.” One look around and it is easy to see that the electronics manufacturing sector \\nmakes “magical” things possible, from ubiquitous connectivity to safer autos and airplanes to \\nmiraculous medical equipment. \\nThe way most modern machines and systems are designed, their users never see the \\nelectronics inside. They may not know what the components are, where they came from, or \\nhow they were put together. People just expect their machines and devices to work. And they do work, thanks to \\nelectronics manufacturers.  \\nOur lives and our communities depend on electronics. And that reliance is only going to grow as systems become \\nsmarter. We are moving toward a world of self-driving vehicles, immersive virtual experiences, and automated \\nenvironments. All of these innovations will be fueled by electronics manufacturers. \\nIn addition to influencing how we live, work, and play on a daily basis, electronics manufacturers comprise a \\nsignificant component of the nation’s industrial base. To update and deepen our knowledge of the industry, IPC \\nworked with INFORUM (Interindustry Forecasting at the University of Maryland) to measure the contributions of \\nelectronics manufacturers to the U.S. economy. \\nAt each step of the electronics manufacturing supply chain, workers earn compensation, and value is added to \\nthe national economy. In addition to these direct impacts, electronics manufacturers also purchase goods and \\nservices from other domestic industries, generating indirect economic activity in those industries. Likewise, \\nemployees in the electronics manufacturing sector spend their earnings on groceries, services, and consumer \\ngoods, and those induced benefits help local and national economies in additional ways. \\nThese direct, indirect and induced effects can be measured across employment, income, output, and contribution \\nto economic growth. These are the tangible economic benefits of electronics manufacturing in the United States. \\nHowever, there are intangible benefits that are equally meaningful. It’s the connection you feel when you reach \\na loved one on the phone, no matter where they are. The security you feel driving a vehicle with cutting-edge \\nsafety features. The laughter you enjoy watching the latest comedy on your connected television – or on your \\ntablet while away from home. Or the relief you feel when medical professionals take care of your health with \\nstate-of-the-art equipment. \\nThese intangible benefits and many more like them are the result of continuous innovation by electronics \\nmanufacturers. \\nJohn Mitchell  \\nPresident and CEO \\nIPC\\n', metadata={'source': 'C:\\\\Users\\\\vishnu.singh\\\\Downloads\\\\NLP PRACTISE\\\\pdf\\\\Economic-report U.S. Electronics Manufacturing Sector.pdf', 'page': 1}),\n",

       " Document(page_content='4\\nINTERCONNECTING AMERICA’S ECONOMY: EXECUTIVE SUMMARY\\nIPC represents more than 5,900 member-company sites around the world and brings together all of the players \\nin the electronics manufacturing industry, including designers, printed circuit board manufacturers, contract and \\nassembly companies, suppliers and original equipment manufacturers. In the United States, IPC represents more \\nthan 2,700 member-company sites across a diverse collection of industries that are integral parts of the economy. \\nIn addition to summarizing the industry’s direct effects, such as output and labor income, this report provides a \\nmore comprehensive view of electronics manufacturing’s economic contributions.\\nWhen electronics manufacturers purchase services and goods from other sectors to use as inputs in the products \\nthey design and build, they produce economic activity in those sectors. The economic impact created in these \\nsupply chains are called indirect effects. \\nLikewise, employees in the electronics manufacturing sector and related supply chains spend their earnings \\nin downstream sectors, which, in turn, produces a range of economic activities at the local and national levels. \\nThese economic contributions are called induced effects. The total economic contribution of the electronics \\nmanufacturing sector includes these direct, indirect and induced effects.1\\nThis report finds:   \\n• Direct Effects: In the United States, electronics manufacturers directly employ more than 1.3 million workers, \\ncontribute $165.7 billion in labor income and $307.6 billion to GDP , and produce nearly $710 billion in output. \\nThe electronics manufacturing sector plays a vital role in the national economy, accounting for 1.6 percent of \\nGDP and 0.7 percent of jobs. \\n• Indirect and Induced Effects: Including both indirect and induced effects, U.S. electronics manufacturers \\nsupport nearly 5.3 million U.S. jobs, contribute almost $408 billion in labor income each year and $714 \\nbillion to U.S. GDP , and produce $1.46 trillion in output (see Table ES-1). The direct, indirect and induced \\neconomic activity of the electronics manufacturing sector accounts for 3.7 percent of U.S. GDP and 2.8 \\npercent of U.S. jobs. \\nTable ES-1.

Every dollar added to U.S. GDP by the electronics manufacturing sector creates \\n$1.32 elsewhere in the economy. Additionally, every dollar in electronics manufacturing output generates \\n$1.05 of output elsewhere in the economy.\\n• State-Level Employment: The economic impact of the electronics manufacturing sector is important in many \\nindividual states. Ten states have more than 100,000 workers each because of the electronics manufacturing \\nsector. California’s electronics manufacturers directly and indirectly employ more than 942,000 employees, \\nfollowed by Texas (437,400), Massachusetts (160,000), New York (156,000) and Florida (137,000).

INTRODUCTION\\nThe electronics manufacturing sector is a vibrant and dynamic segment of the U.S. economy, with a long \\nhistory of innovation and resiliency dating back to Lee de Forest’s 1906 invention of the three-element vacuum \\ntube. The 1940s brought the introduction of semiconductors, which spawned the modern era of computing and \\ntelecommunications. \\nToday the electronics manufacturing sector is the heart of innovation in every sector of the economy. \\nSmartphones are allowing individuals to connect instantly with friends and family anywhere in the world or order \\ngroceries for home delivery. Robots are transforming warehouse and delivery industries. Cutting-edge medical \\ndiagnostic equipment is saving and improving lives. Electronics manufacturers are empowering the next wave of \\nelectric vehicles, autonomous robots, and top-secret defense technologies.  \\nThe electronics manufacturing sector includes such household names as Apple, Bosch, DuPont, Foxconn, GE \\nMedical Systems, Honeywell, IBM, Intel, Jabil, Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman, and Raytheon. However, 80 \\npercent of U.S. electronics manufacturers are small and medium-sized businesses. Economic activities by these \\ncompanies drive innovation, output and jobs in adjacent industries such as aerospace, automotive, medical and \\ndefense.   \\nThis study finds that the electronics manufacturing sector directly contributes roughly $308 billion to U.S. GDP \\nand employs over 1.3 million U.S. workers. The electronics manufacturing sector accounts for 1.6 percent of \\nU.S. GDP and 0.7 percent of U.S. jobs. Electronics manufacturing activity, however, does not exist in isolation. \\nIncluding both indirect and induced effects, U.S. electronics manufacturers support nearly 5.3 million jobs, \\ncontribute almost $408 billion in labor income each year, add $714 billion to GDP , and produce $1.46 trillion in \\noutput. The direct, indirect and induced economic activity of the electronics manufacturing sector accounts for 3.7 \\npercent of U.S. GDP and 2.8 percent of U.S. jobs. \\nThe following section describes the methodology used to estimate these impacts. Section 3 provides quantitative \\nresults showing electronics manufacturing’s contribution at the national and state levels. Section 4 provides \\na quantitative analysis of where the output of U.S. electronics manufacturers goes.

METHODOLOGY AND KEY TERMS\\nThis study defines electronics manufacturing to include the following diverse industries in the North American \\nIndustry Classification System (NAICS):\\n• NAICS 3341 - Computer and Peripheral Equipment Manufacturing\\n• NAICS 3342 - Communications Equipment Manufacturing\\n• NAICS 3343 - Audio and Video Equipment Manufacturing\\n• NAICS 3344 - Semiconductor and Other Electronic Component Manufacturing\\n• NAICS 3345 - Navigational, Measuring, Electromedical, and Control Instruments Manufacturing\\n• NAICS 3353 – Electrical Equipment Manufacturing\\n• NAICS 3359 - Other Electrical Equipment and Component Manufacturing\\n• NAICS 33632 - Motor Vehicle Electrical and Electronic Equipment Manufacturing\\nThe calculated economic impacts presented in this study use input-output (IO) analysis to quantify the \\ninterdependencies that exist between different sectors of the economy. IO analysis can be used to estimate chains \\nof effects that occur through the interrelationships among businesses, government and households. In this way, \\nIO analysis enables an examination of interindustry relationships within an economy and, in turn, can characterize \\nthe effects of a change in one sector on the broader economy. This analysis uses the 2017 IMPLAN database and \\nmodel. All economic impacts are in inflation-adjusted 2017 dollars (2017$). All results are for calendar year 2017. \\nThe three types of economic impacts we derive in this study are:\\n• Direct Impacts—Activity generated within the focus industry. In this case, electronics manufacturing activity \\nserves as the direct impact.\\n• Indirect Impacts—Activity generated in other industries as a result of purchases (materials, energy and \\nservices) by the focus industry through the supply chain. For example, an automobile manufacturing firm \\nmight purchase tires, steel and electrical components to produce its final product.\\n• Induced Impacts—Activity generated by purchases of households from income earned from direct and \\nindirect production. \\nThis report provides estimates for the direct, indirect, and induced impacts on:\\n• Employment — Employment is the people employed by an industry. Employment figures use the Bureau \\nof Economic Analysis (BEA) and Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) full-time/part-time annual average for a \\ngiven industry. The data covers both wage and salary employees and those who are self-employed.\\n• Labor Income — Labor income, a component of value added, is the sum of salary/wages and supplements. \\nSupplements may take the form of employer contributions for employee pensions and insurance funds \\n(such as health insurance). This measure also includes proprietor income.\\n• Value Added — Value added is the industry’s contribution to GDP and represents the enhancement a \\nmanufacturer provides (e.g., assembly) to a product before offering it to the end consumer. Put another \\nway, value added is the difference between total revenue of an industry and the cost of intermediate \\ninputs. Components of value added include employee labor compensation, taxes on production and \\nimports, and gross operating surplus (including profits).\\n• Output — Output, in economic terms, refers to the total value of all goods and services produced by an \\nindustry. This includes both intermediate demand (sales of intermediate inputs to other industries) and \\nfinal demand.', metadata={'source': 'C:\\\\Users\\\\vishnu.singh\\\\Downloads\\\\NLP PRACTISE\\\\pdf\\\\Economic-report U.S. Electronics Manufacturing Sector.pdf', 'page': 9}),\n",
       " Document(page_content='9\\nThe Economic Impacts of the  U.S. Electronics Manufacturing SectorIO analysis utilizes tables that show the interrelationships between industries. Looking down the column of a \\ntable, we see all the inputs of other industries used to produce that industry’s product. Looking across the row \\nof a table, we see the industries and final uses that industry sells to. We use these tables to calculate the indirect \\nimpacts of a given industry’s production.\\nEach analysis presented in this report focuses on a region, such as the United States or one state, and examines \\nthe total contributions of the electronics manufacturing sector in that region. \\nMeasures of output include double-counting. For example, the tire used to build a motor vehicle is counted both \\nas output of tires and as output of motor vehicles. This is important only if both are produced in the same region. \\nHowever, employment, labor income and value added are additive, that is to say, not double-counted. Many slices \\nof value added contribute to the final value of a product or service.\\nIn addition to analyzing the economic contribution at the national level, this report also quantifies electronics \\nmanufacturing’s impact for 16 state economies.

Output and jobs are also supported in supplier (“indirect”) industries \\nthat provide components, materials, energy and various services to the electronics manufacturing sector. \\nAdditionally, individuals employed by electronics manufacturers and related suppliers earn income, a portion \\nof which is used to purchase consumer goods and services, creating jobs and output in other industries. These \\neconomic impacts are known as “induced” effects.\\nTable 2 summarizes the sector’s direct, indirect, and induced impacts in employment, labor income, value added, \\nand output. Electronics manufacturers directly employ over 1.3 million people, generate over $307 billion in value \\nadded and contribute nearly $710 billion in output. This can be seen in the first row of Table 2. \\nIn total, electronics manufacturing activity helps support 5.3 million  \\njobs and $714 billion in value added to the national economy.\\nDirect economic activity by the electronics manufacturing sector also generates economic activity throughout \\nother sectors of the country, as shown on the second row of Table 2. As a of result of annual economic activity by \\nelectronics manufacturers, upstream suppliers generate over $340 billion in output and employ nearly 1.5 million \\npeople. The supply chain adds $176.6 billion to GDP as a result of economic activity by electronics manufacturers. \\nFinally, a portion of the labor income earned by workers in electronics manufacturing and related suppliers is \\nspent on goods and services in other sectors of the economy. This activity, shown in the third row of Table 2, \\nsupports nearly 2.5 million jobs and generates over $400 billion in output. \\nIn total, the electronics manufacturing sector helps support approximately 5.3 million U.S. jobs; produces nearly \\n$408 billion in labor income; contributes $714 billion to U.S. GDP; and drives $1.5 trillion in U.S. output. \\nEconomic multipliers illustrate the impact one sector has on the broader economy. In mathematical terms, \\neconomic multipliers describe the ratio of the sum of indirect and induced impacts to direct impacts. The data \\nshown in Table 2 and Figure 3 indicate that one electronics manufacturing job helps support 3.0 other jobs in \\nthe national economy.2 Additionally, one dollar in electronics manufacturing output generates $1.05 of output \\nelsewhere in the economy.3 Additional information on electronics manufacturing’s contributions can be found in \\nFact Sheet #1 of Appendix A.\\nTable 2.

CONCLUSIONS \\nThe electronics manufacturing sector fills many critical roles in the U.S. economy, and in dozens of adjacent \\nindustries, including transportation, aerospace and defense, and medical services, among many others. \\nWhile its goods and services are generally hidden out of sight, the industry designs, builds, tests, and services \\nthousands of intermediate and final products used billions of times per day by consumers around the world. \\nThe many positive economic impacts of electronics manufacturing in the United States include millions of jobs, \\nand hundreds of billions of dollars’ worth of labor income and value-added. \\nThe benefits are most pronounced in 16 states that account for approximately 80 percent of national electronics \\nmanufacturing output; but the benefits are also generated in and shared across all 50 states and U.S territories.\\nAnd while this report does not delve into the implications of this industry’s value to the economy, it is clear that \\nthe industry has thrived in the United States due to that nation’s longtime strengths in education, workforce, \\nresearch, innovation, and business environment. \\nTo the extent those historic strengths may be at risk in today’s world, the United States risks its future world \\nleadership and prosperity. Leaders in United States and all nations who are interested in future prosperity should \\ngive high priority to creating a positive policy and business environment for the electronics manufacturing \\nindustry. \\nIPC will continue to foster and promote industry standards to help ensure superior quality of electronics products \\nand services, environmentally friendly operations, and intellectual property protection. We will continue to \\noperate the industry’s leading training and worker certifications to help provide the workforce of today and \\ntomorrow. We will conduct and publish unique industry research to help all parties make more informed \\ndecisions. And we will continue to advocate for pro-growth, pro-innovation, science-based policies in all nations.\\n ', metadata={'source': 'C:\\\\Users\\\\vishnu.singh\\\\Downloads\\\\NLP PRACTISE\\\\pdf\\\\Economic-report U.S. Electronics Manufacturing Sector.pdf', 'page': 33}),\n",

Arizona\\n2. California\\n3. Colorado\\n4. Florida\\n5. Illinois\\n6. Massachusetts7. Michigan\\n8. Minnesota\\n9. New Jersey\\n10. New York\\n11. North Carolina\\n12. Ohio13. Oregon\\n14. Pennsylvania\\n15. Texas\\n16. Wisconsin\\nAt the top of each fact sheet are general facts about the region. These pertain to the entire economy, helping to \\ngive perspective to the electronics manufacturing impacts listed underneath. \\nThe second block summarizes the industry’s direct economic effects in terms of employment, labor income, value \\nadded, and output. The chart also shows electronics manufacturing’s share of regional GDP , calculated by dividing \\ndirect value-added by the gross regional product. Labor income per worker is derived by dividing electronics \\nmanufacturing labor income by employment.\\nThe third block in each table describes electronics manufacturing’s direct impacts, the impacts of upstream \\nsuppliers (indirect), and associated income-related (induced) effects.\\nNext, two different multipliers are provided. Economic multipliers describe the ratio of the sum of indirect and \\ninduced impacts to direct impacts. For employment multipliers, take the sum of indirect and induced employment \\nand divide it by direct employment. Similarly, output multipliers can be calculated by adding indirect and induced \\noutput together and dividing it by direct output.\\n ', metadata={'source': 'C:\\\\Users\\\\vishnu.singh\\\\Downloads\\\\NLP PRACTISE\\\\pdf\\\\Economic-report U.S. Electronics Manufacturing Sector.pdf', 'page': 34}),\n",

Each layer in the encoder has two sub-layers: a multi-head self-attention mechanism and a simple, position-wise fully connected feed-forward network.

At each step, the model is auto-regressive [10], consuming the previously generated symbols as additional input when generating the next.\n",
